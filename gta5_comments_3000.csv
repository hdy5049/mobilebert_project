"I always thought that modding was a great thing to do in single player.   Now that Rockstar has killed tools that allowed modding of Grand theft Auto 5 by threatening to sue the amkers, which advocated for single use only, I feel compelled to voice my disapproval.  Modding has always been a key feature of the PC and has allowed the game’s lifespan to be extended.  I want to add my voice against this practice even thouh I never installed mods.",1.0

"Used to be on my BEST GAME EVER list.Now filled up with terrorible gamers, with either horrible skills or manner. Hard to enjoy. Trying hard to buy cool stuff, by joining in millions of quests, then get fuxked by cash players HEAD-TO-TOE. Basically no  in-game payment  no joy.Less and less fun of  cooperation .

I got the one month ban because i used a mod menu. After the ban got lifted didnt use a single cheat. I was hiding behind the ledge by the helipad port by the water and some guy with a laser decided to try and shoot me but he hit the wall and crashed at the same time. That i was a modder. Hours later i get perma banned. Period this complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Good thing i got this game when it was on sale for 25 bucks. Rockstar are bunch of ♥♥♥♥boys.,1.0

"This is the major example of a wasted potential in AAA game. Don't get me wrong - the singleplayer is one of the most intense ones I have ever played. However, the decisions made for the online mode are the prime examples of what not to do with a great product - and how to drive your creation straight to the trash can. Here are the biggest cons that were not present at the release of the game, but are now a thing due to the most mindboggling decisions made by Rockstar Games and Take-Two:- The studio only supports online mode, and any new DLC vehicles since the beggining of 2016 are not being released to the singleplayer, therefore players which want to test new vehicles before buying them have to mod single player - which Take-Two just made almost impossible by shutting down OpenIV, a modding tool used to mod GTA games since 2009.- Even with the shift to online, singleplayer is still a lot more immersing. Rockstar encourages players to only play online by releasing free DLC's only to that mode - but online still feels like a cheaper version of the singleplayer experience. Even the simple things, like animals not being present in online since 2013, make online appear much less polished than the singleplayer.  - Another big problem are the Shark Cards - the prices of them are just plain stupid. Overall, the pricing of vehicles shifted a lot after the heist update in 2015. The prices of Shark Cards did not change since 2013. Before the heist update, the biggest 8MLN in-game dollars Megalodon Shark Card could buy you almost all of the in-game content for 100$. All of the content from the newest DLC, Gunrunning, costs around 40MLN in-game dollars - which translates roughly to 500$. We have to remember that all of the DLC's since the release of the game are free - that ""unfortunately"" does not justify the content hiding behind a 500$ paywall.- If you are one of those people that do not want to spend any money via microtransactions, turn away from this title. Everything is hiding behind a neverending grind. In-game jobs pay nothing, and still, after 2 years, the best way to make money is by grinding heists - which released in 2015. The community is so upset at this fact that every two online lobbies, you will see people begging modders to drop them money.- Adding to the topic of modders - online mode is filled with them. I, personally, have a mixed opinion about them. Rockstar can't control them since the release for PC. Modders can create the most hilarious and fun moments of online - or they can simply wipe your account and even steal your IP adress - as you can see, they are totally out of Rockstar's control.- Last thing I am going to write about is purely subjective, and is about the content added in the new DLC's. I am one of those ""rare"" casual players that would like to drive vehicles into the back of the Titan (which is not possible since the release of the game) or go offroading and hunting in the countryside with a couple of friends (as I said before, hunting is not possible due to animals not being present in the online mode). Instead, we get new super cars added in almost every DLC. For me, GTA has always been about having fun - not grinding missions to unlock the ""fun"" content. Even simple things like custom lobbies with police, player icons or friendly fire disabled - which were present in GTA IV - are not possible in GTA Online. Thank you for reading my review. As I said, in my opinion, GTA V is the best example of a wasted potential I have ever seen in a video game. This game released in 2013 and with the right development could still be one of the top contenders for the best sandbox, best racing game and even the best fps (because of the next gen option of first person camera mode). Unfortunately, in my opinion, it will not be any of those any soon. Also, adding more context to my review - I have been playing this game since the release, both on Xbox 360 and PC. I think that with the recent shutdown of OpenIV, it is the highest time the community should speak up and protest against the greed of Rockstar and Take-Two.Sincerely, a disappointed GTA fan.",1.0
"Finally! THE PC VERSION IS FINALLY OUT, and IT'S AWESOME!Go guys, get this game, cuz this game is the game that every single PC player should play!For me it's the best game I played at last 3 - 5 years.Thanks ROCKSTAR GAMES Studio for this MASTERPIECE!",1.0
"Just to get one point out of the way, I am reviewing this game as a single player experience. I haven’t really experienced the online part, more than playing through the introduction, but there are a lot of other steam reviews mentioning online play, and according to some of them and some youtubers, Rockstar has been banning a lot of innocent players. So yeah, if you want info on the online experience check out other comments and reviews.As for GTA 5’s story mode and single player experience, I feel it is a great GTA game and certainly worth a buy for those that are a fan of the feel and gameplay of the series. Though there are some things I wish would have been a bit different.That scene…The torture scene… Now I am not against extreme and uncomfortable scenes in games if they serve a proper purpose. However, this didn’t really serve any purpose for me. I already knew at this point in the game that the character was deranged and a despicable human being, controlling him as he tortured someone for information couldn’t possibly lower my opinion of him any further.I feel like this scene was simply put in to generate controversy about the game and get people talking, so more people would buy the game because of the controversy… Which in truth it did get a lot of people talking when the game first came out. So, yay? Didn’t really do anything for the story. You already knew the agencies in GTA were corrupt, you knew Trevor was the evilest character in the game… Nothing was really achieved other than making the player torture someone. The charactersThen there are the three main characters themselves… Which I feel was a mistake. I much prefer just playing as one character, especially with Michael being the most interesting GTA protagonist I have played so far. The most interesting supporting cast is also closely related to Michael, mainly his dysfunctional family. I would have preferred the game focusing more on him, possibly just making Franklin a heist member, and turning Trevor into the main antagonist of the game.Franklin suffers from the same problem that CJ had in GTA San Andreas. He is just really boring… Unlike CJ though, most of the characters around Franklin are boring too. Mostly just coming into the story to remind him that he isn’t black enough and giving up on the hood, because he is trying to get out of there and move up in the world. CJ at least had the best antagonists I have seen in the series, and an insane - but also hilariously over the top girlfriend/ex-girlfriend - Franklin… He has a special ability that makes racing easier? Other than that, he can be easily replaced by every other character. Plus switching between other characters, Franklin will often switch to ugly baggy clothes like some teenager trying to be cool… So I constantly have to run back home to change his outfit to something that makes him look half decent. As for Trevor… It is really weird playing as the most messed up and psychotic character in a GTA game. Usually you play a guy like Franklin or Michael, clearly both guys doing bad things. But they are the kind of bad guys you send in to deal with the even worse guys. Trevor is as close as you get to a bad guy, and I can best describe him as the Joker of the GTA universe. For ♥♥♥♥ sake… We are introduced to him killing a guy, because the guy is upset that Trevor is ♥♥♥♥ing his girlfriend. Note the guy DOES NOT! Take the first hostile action. Trevor does when the guy doesn’t instantly ♥♥♥♥ off... Trevor has no real redeeming qualities, and by all accounts he should be the main bad guy at the end of the game, because he is often the main cause of conflict.Then there are the villains… With three main characters, all switching between the spotlight, there aren’t much time left to let any villain shine, which results in a series of smaller forgettable bad guys. Especially since Trevor is often just on the verge of being a full-on villain to Michael. Which is a shame, seeing as San Andreas had amazing villains and a great climax, the GTA 5 climax is more meh...A great thing is that you can give all of the protagonists glorious beards, which really helps improve their ugly faces.Stay positiveOkay so that was the negatives out of the way. Now for the more positive. The gameplay feels much more smooth to me than it has in previous titles. Everything is nice and easy to control once you get the hang of it, well possibly except for helicopters, but I will never learn to properly fly and land those things in GTA. :P I also like the skills of the various characters such as driving and shooting, and that certain ones of them are relatively fast to level up, especially flying at the flying school. It is nice that they haven’t brought back annoying stats like fat.So the core of the gameplay is very enjoyable, and the other drivers have improved a lot too. In previous games, if I tried to drive normal. (Waiting on traffic lights, driving in the correct lanes, matching the speed of the other cars) Which I often do in missions where the characters are having conversations, I would often get slammed into by cars deciding to make a sudden turn. In about 60 hours of GTA 5 I didn’t experience that happening even once to myself, though I did see a few others driving into other cars, but not into me by accident. :) There are also several random encounters, which spice up the city and make it feel alive. Some are just people wanting to get driven places and give a few bucks. But some are more interesting or funny. For example, I suddenly saw hostiles on the map, and decided to check it out because I hadn’t really done anything to warrant hostiles at that time. After shooting them it turned out I saved a girl from being murdered over her dad’s criminal past, and after driving her home I was later contacted getting 60.000 put into the character’s account. Which I felt was a lot for a random encounter.  There are also some great songs mixed into the different radio stations. Since I have been watching Archer a lot lately, I was really excited when I suddenly heard they were playing Danger Zone by Kenny Loggins.A lot of the minigames are also fun side distractions. Personally I found playing tennis as Michael to be very relaxing.End remarksSo yeah, two out of three protagonists suck, the antagonists aren’t very fleshed out or memorable, the core of the game is great, the city feels more alive, and the radio has good songs mixed in.",1.0

"The PC version of GTA V is definitely the best version. We had to wait really long, but the game finally came out in a fantastic state.",1.0
"At this point they should not even publish a PC port. The controls are a nightmare (example: swimming), and to add insult to injury nothing is explained properly (like how to swim UP). I spent probably half my game time in the key bindings settings trying to figure out how to complete the current quest. Then add the just disastrous decision to have three half-baked characters instead of one good one, and all the little glitches like quest targets disappearing behind walls. Story is boring as hell compared to older GTAs (e.g. Vice City). For me the second worst GTA of all time (with San Andreas still number one). And instead of a real DLC such as ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"" for GTA IV they keep adding online modes.Oh and by the way, the ""world record"" on the airport race is 0.170 seconds at the time of this review. Yes, less than a second for two laps around the airport. Basically all the top places in all such modes, be it golfing or races or anything, are cheated.

"In all honesty, this game is not worth it's price, maybe... $5, if I want to be nice.. $10. It's just.. the only things good about this game is MAYBE the interesting character customization and the single player storyline. That's it.You're very likely to get banned over nothing as the bots responsible for banning cheaters and hackers are horribly made, and if you DO get banned, you'll never see the light of day in this game as the company, themselves, will just throw your ticket in the trash and run away with your precious money that you spent on this game. And yes, they'd rather lose their fans than actually own up to their mistakes and fix it.The community, itself, is also horrible, I've never seen such an anti-user friendly game until now. You could be someone who just started 2 seconds ago and already get killed by some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ player for no damn reason at all. Like, no one gives a flying ♥♥♥♥ who you are and they'll let you know in a heartbeat.To be honest, you're better off pirating this game than actually buying it, it's not really worth your money at all.

"the game can be fun, but over the years, it seems like its just trying to get every last penny out of people, and this is shown when Take2 took action against the single player modding community. Bad choice on T2 and rockstars behave. Take 2 int. learn from you mistakes, most of the time, the people who buy your damn games knows what is best for them... rather than removing a really big part of the game that still makes it relivent today, maby you should embrase modding with open arms. It seems like the people who actually play the game know the difference between modders and hackers, modders make the game theirs by creating what they want, and share it with people, and overall make a more enjoyable game to play, while hackers make the game theirs by destroing other peoples online exsperence, and making people mad by using cheap hacks. Lets be real, the only thing that will benifit you is if you take your head out of your♥♥♥♥♥ and stop worring about you microtransactions, and just make a fun game that does not have to give people cancer when they want to have fun... it should not be hard, and i bet any mistakes along the way will minor to what happend right now... be smart, dont make your company fall apart under you... listen to your fans, they know what is best Take 2",1.0
"This is a review of GTA V Online. I give GTA V 5/5 stars.  GTA Online is the best/worse game I have ever played. It somehow creates this perfect balance between being absolutely fantastic with the detailed missions, gameplay, story, and open world but at the same time completely pisses you off by requiring three other players to work with you as a ""team"" while simultaneously expecting you to complete missions with very specific requirements that aren't intuitive and must be learned from repeated failures. GTA 5 Online has a terrible learning curve that pays in negative dividends.The heists in particular are the worst. They are neat in concept, but the execution is terrible especially when considering you HAVE to have three other people to do the mission.For example a heist called the Pacific Standard Job. During the final heist you have to rob a bank and escape on specific motorcycles the mission forces you to use and you are forced to get to those motorcycles through a very specific path while walking over checkpoints. MIss a checkpoint? Fail the mission.  The motorcycles are a terrible choice for the mission and exist to only make the mission artificially more difficult. In fact ironically Rockstar had to eliminate the ability to stash an armored karuma because god forbid players would find a more practical solution to an impractical heist. And that my friends it the core of why I hate GTA Online. An open world game ironically on rails because players find better solutions to stupid problems Rockstar comes up with instead of making missions difficult because it makes sense. Ironically Rockstar is constantly releasing vehicles that cost millions of in game dollars that you can't use on certain missions. It's ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I imagine it's because it fuels Rockstar's shark card business (i.e. pay to play business). The missions just end up being frustrating or the missions are a grind. Either way you lose. Most of the time the missions are difficult because the matchmaking is terrible and you're forced to either team up with noobs (who don't understand the details of the mission) or people from other countries who don't speak English. Imagine trying to work as a team with someone who doesn't even speak your language? It sucks.Also the newer DLC missions like CEO, Bunker, or Hanger are just grind fests to obtain new vehicles. Some of the missions are fun but you end up doing all of the missions dozens of times in order to make money to buy new vehicles that you ironically can't use on certain missions because it would be too easy. lol    The most frustrating thing of all is knowing that on rare occasions everything falls into place. You have the right team with the right skills and the right equipment and for a minute or perhaps an hour the game is the most amazing experience ever. I guess if you buy this game with three other dedicated buddies you will have an amazing time. But if you lack even one of those three enjoy the frustration of having a random Chinese dude who doesn't speak english, doesn't give a♥♥♥♥♥♥about playing as a team, and will screw over your team over and over again before you smash your keyboard on the hardwood floor.",1.0
I would love to give this game a great review. Because come on its Grand Theft Auto 5 and it runs great on PC. But Rockstar is making it more and more difficult to mod. One of the main reasons I'm a PC gamer. I could do without multiplayer personally and the overpriced cash cards for the ability to mod.,1.0
"The story mode is really great and it is pretty neat to have 3 main protagonists that you may switch to at any given time. When I first played GTA V on console I was very blown away. On PC it is even better since you can enter first-person mode and achieve 60fps. It is a shame that they did not release any major story mode DLC, which isn't too bad. As for Online mode, there are lots of great things about it, and things not so great. When GTA IV came out with online features, it was cool to be able to free roam or do death matches or whatever. GTA V's online has evolved way beyond that with the ability to customize your character, own and customize vehicles, and live in apartments. I am extremely impressed with how long Rockstar has been able to keep the updates and new content coming for  GTA Online. However, over time things just got worse as in-game items have become more and more expensive and if you don't grind for days, you pretty much have to open your wallet to buy shark cards to keep up with everyone else that like to blow you up for no reason or have maxed out cars that have the advantage in races. Besides the ridiculous prices, I am still blown away by the core features of Online which let you drive/roam around freely on such a huge map, hang out with friends, race cars, do missions either solo or in a group and a lot more things to explore. As great as GTA V is, I can't even imagine what they will eventually bring us with GTA 6.",0.0
"By far the best GTA so far. Singleplayer has a great story line from what I have played and a lot of features that aren't in the multiplayer but the multiplayer also has features the singleplayer doesn't so it balances itself. At almost the 100 hr mark. I've spent I would say about 80% of it in online. It has got to be my favorite. The heists are great if you can get 4 decent people together and I haven't encountered many trolls except in races. Buying 10 car garages and filling them with custom cars is my hobby. There are a lot of cars all with different mods and some more than others. Some have to be stolen and some have to be bought. Grinding money can be tedious if you can't get 4 people together, the regular jobs and knocking off corner stores don't pay that much and doing them alone can be risky sometimes. All in all the Multiplayer is great if you got people to play with. As for Singleplayer I can't really say too much about it since I haven't really played much of it. I do recommend the game to anyone looking for fun online for sure though.",1.0

"This game was something I was looking for to play with friends and for a time it was actually fun, until you start realising the game is a huge grind and pay to play, you can't steal cars and keep them, the game is GRAND THEFT AUTO yet you have to buy all the fun cars from a website! They constantly release new content, which consists of even more expesive cars, which you can't afford, unless you buy their shark cards or grind for hours on end. They almost never release new content with missions, there are no new heists. The game had fun glitches that lauched you sky high, or secret glitches that let you earn more money, they fixed that and I lost all interest in a pay to play game that is full price, this game can not live up to the fun times I had in GTA IV, where online mods were allowed and there were servers just for modders! They never allowed such a thing in GTA V because of their shark cards. And recently Take 2 and Rockstar decided to remove even single player mods, SINGLEPLAYER MODS! They can't earn money from that, no idea why they did this but this game has just shot it's self in the foot and I don't think they can recover from this. Sad part is I can't refund it after 77h of game time.Just save your money and buy something better.",1.0

"I really wish I could rate GTA 5 twice - once for single player and again for multiplayer.The single player game is amazing, it's so well done with great characters, story and voice acting. The music in this game is just fantastic too, with a few songs I'd never before that are now some of my favorites. The gameplay was smooth on a mid-range system, always entertaining and hilarious at times and I don't recall any real bugs or issues that I came across (this is playing within the last year). As a single player game, I highly recommend GTA 5.Multiplayer on the other hand, is absolute trash. I'd read about what I'd be getting into so there were no real surprises but what Rockstar has done with GTA Online is just shameful. Hackers/modders are rampant and will wreck your gameplay. I started GTA Online a couple weeks ago and just can't do it anymore, it's so frustrating and the player base (modders and cheaters) is just trash. It's not only me who is frustrated by it, I've seen so many people rage quit out of GTA Online after getting targeted and harassed by modders.Why Rockstar doesn't hammer the modders and cheaters is beyond me. They just don't seem to care that the rest of their players are affected by it. I guess as long as the boatloads of Shark Card money keeps coming in, who cares right?

This is a game that you have fun i recommend that you get it if you have a friend because it is not fun for playing solo and it is fun to fly a plane with a friend and troll do all sorts of stuff so if you are going to buy it and play with a friend you will not worry if they get bored because they will not get bored it is fun with a friend :D so yea for me is recommended if you are going to play with a friend.first of all they are saying that there are hackers and rdm me i never had a player that always shots me or troll or a player that hacks till now so yea don't see the comments of gta v that there are hackers umm warning if you see an hacker leave if you don't leave he can give you alot of money and you can get baned 99.9% so this is my recommendation i hope you get some info from this XD.,1.0

"Rockstar. Read the ****ing reviews. Your game is infested with modders/ hackers. It is next to impossible to get a match with no hackers.

At this point all I can do is play in private matches with my friends but even then its disapointing because im over here driving my ****mobile and they are driving really nice cars that they got instantly. I can't even enjoy the game the way its ment to be played. Everytime I try to defend my VIP a modder will instantly TP over there and just aimbot him.

Rockstar just threw up their hand and said they didn't do anything, That they had no control which is just as bad. They made so much money off people paying for their game and pelnty of people bought it on pc for the moding. They continue to prove they don't care at all about single player and want people to move to online which is plaged with so many problems, Hacker, insain grinding for little profit, The whole issue with someone running you over and you can't do squat back because they ride an expincive car that YOU have to pay for even if they stared it if you kill it in revenge.

"I personally don't mod in GTA, so i am not too effected by the modding ban. However, i feel that banning mods was the wrong move and should have been free to do so in single player. I also hate the fact that you have to grind the heck out of missions and repeat jobs constantly essentially trying to force you into buying shark cards to get the COOL STUFF. So that gets really boring. I could spend a whole day writing a more in-depth review about it, but these are the main things that make GTA5 not fun anymore. If you want to avoid ruining your rep anymore Rockstar, i would advise bringging back mods and making new stuff cheaper so we aren't being pushed into buying your shark cards for in-game money.",0.0

"I never played a GTA game before, so when I heard all the hype about this game, I was expecting an experience like no other.Of course, I met no such thing. I am not saying the game is bad, cause it's not, in fact it's quite fantastic. It just isn't as ""special"" as I thought it would be. First missions in the story mode were driving, shooting, driving, shooting, and more shooting. Multiplayer is not that much fun unless you have a bunch of friends with you. Still, I recommend this game cause there are tons of things I haven't experienced yet, and the amount of content is pretty damn awesome. If someone else tells you to get this game, you probably should.",1.0

Take Two wants to milk as much money from you as possible, I guess having the 4th largest game of all time isn't good enough for them.  They've shut down OpenIV which is the backbone of many essential SINGLEPLAYER mods in an effort to drive people to GTA: Online so they can try and sell shark cards to you.  Its disgusting.  Don't buy this game and support these two companies.  No longer buying a rockstar game or take two games until this is addressed and fixed.",1.0

"It started with having to sign up to a service outside of the game and Steam, then froze my PC once the loading for the storymode finished for the first time. (restarting fixed this). Movement is generally quite sluggish and the tutorial doesn't explain a lot of mechanics such as snow slowing you if you walk in it, the proper controls for avoiding car turns becoming donuts, and the tutorial was vague at best when it comes to clarity of controls. For a console port, it runs fairly well, but I still can't recommend the game at anything above 50% of the price it is at the time of this review.I got enticed by the nostalgia of the old games, but this one is nothing like the classics such as Vice City or San Andreas.",1.0

Constantly put in online rooms alone. Forced to change your targeting system or your not playing with a vast mojority of the community. If your using mouse and keyboard free aim your gunna play alone. If your a kiddie playing witha a controller with lock on targeting then your grouped. If I wanted that Id go back to playing it on my ps4/3. Pay to win progression on money system getting little pay outs for activities making you want to buy shark cards. But thats pointless cause a random modder will join and boost your lvl or money. Then youll log back on and its all gone. I support them not allowing mods as it breaks the game for online players.

"This is a great game, when it decides to workI have had this game for about 8 months or so and it installed just fine and worked fine for about a week. After that the game just randomly decides to not function for a number of various reasons that it decides are a good idea.  Now this doesnt happen all the time or daily but it does happen offten enough that it has driven me to give it a negative review.Here are a list of just SOME of the problems that i have encountered while trying to use this game.-Game boots up fine and boots into the story or online fine, but after about 5- 10 min in it crashes and give some cryptic error message about the graphics not being initiallized or something. ( i know this not to be the problem with my computer because i have had this problem happen on THREE computers all with different hardware)-Game doesn't even start. Click on the GTA V icon, looks normal but crashes and says it failed.-Game just randomly doesn't work anymore, had to reinstall twice before it worked again.-deleted my clound sync data and i lose all of my progress in the game. (i had finished the game)-decides not to connect to online just because (not my router as i went to youtube and it worked fine, also i dont think it was there servers becaseu a friend of mine could get online just fine.)-Straight up vanishes from my desktop. I'm not kidding, no i didnt uninstall it was just gone one day ( The icon just vanished not the whole game.-while using hardware capable or getting 60+ fps on high settings, GTA decides that a solid 10-15 FPS is way more playable. (probably not my hardware as a friend had the same exact thing happen to him.)Now dont get my wrong, when the game funtions it is a phenomenal game, amazing graphics, great story, great gameplay etc. But the fact that it crashes and breaks this much is very annoying, not to mention the presence of online hackers.

"I can recommend the singleplayer, if that's your thing.The multiplayer has lots of potential, but is only being abused by the developers and publishers to lure players into spending real money for overpriced ingame stuff that is mostly there to show off or troll other players. Of course, you can earn it all ingame after hours of repetitive grinding. It takes some time until it gets repetitive, but eventually it does.Then there are lots of hackers, who apparently can do anything they want. Sometimes you will just die, other times you will suddenly have insane amounts of ammunition for a weapon unobtainable in multiplayer (so you actually look like a hacker), if you're unlucky you will just lose money or RP.There is some freeroam stuff to do, which is not bad, but gets repetitive quickly. Also you need a good amount of money until you are able to start with it. Everything else is locked behind an atrocious lobby system, which will eat up your time. You will spend much time searching for a lobby or have the game search one for you, whereas there are way too few filter options or a *just take me to a lobby that is about to start* feature. You will spend loads of time waiting in lobbies, watching how two players leave out of boredom right in the second the last player to fill the lobby joins. You will spend motherloads of time looking at a faded out top down view on the city, which acts as the loading screen, because each time you enter a lobby or the game decides to kick you out of one or move you to another or when you're about to enter an actual game session this screen turns up. Sometimes it won't even go away. It will just stay there and after five or ten minutes you need to decide whether to restart the game or keep waiting. I've seen loading screens disappear as if nothing was wrong after fifteen minutes of waiting and no indication or whatsoever what it was doing. And if you manage to get in a lobby that starts a game after waiting you will in many cases be presented a minigame-like session, whereas the minigames are sometimes fun, but often not well thought-through and as soon as you are starting to have fun, the round ends and you get back to your beloved lobby. And if you decide you want to play another gamemode, you can't just change it, even if all the people in your session want it, because the game will present you only a random subset of available modes. You'll have to go through the loading screen to freeroam, then through another one to a new session.This game (also online mode) could've easily become the game of the decade, but the developers and publishers decided to get a high rank in the list of games where you can buy the grind away and the list of games with the worst development decisions after a well-made and potent base has been established.",1.0
"I really want to love this game, but Rockstar has ruined it. The size and attention to detail in the map creates the best play area I've ever seen in a game. Even after 100 hours you can still find new places you never knew about. This makes it the perfect open-world game to just get with your friends and do whatever for hours. Unfortunately it seems like Rockstar doesn't want you to do this.In order to have fun in this game you have to first spend a ton of time slowly gaining money in-game. Every update that adds new things to the game requires more and more money. It's no doubt that this is to get players to purchase Shark Cards with real money.There is a way to get around this though. Mods. They let you do everything you ever wanted but couldn't do because Rockstar never added it themselves. Just run a FiveM server and add mods to your game. No more wasting 50 hours to get enough money for a car. You could just spawn it in and not worry about it being blown up costing $12,000. Unfortunately these 3rd party server mods were forced to shut down by the game owner. This leaves us with the broken system that Rockstar made, and no other option but to get banned for using mods in official servers.

The whole point of GTA, is to steal cars...yet you have to buy what you want here. Every update is a copy/paste of the last update's mission structure. So in order to enjoy the game, people have resorted to mods which was giving the game some life back...and Take Two decides to put an end to that, most likely out of spite that people are enjoying their game, but not on their accord. What a shame, as Rockstar was my one company that never did any wrong...and I tried to pretend they were still great, but they've just pushed it to the absolute limit. Adding them to my list alongside Ubisoft and EA.",1.0
Gta IV was better and did a lot if things better.But Gta V has underwater areas that you will never care to go to after like the tenth time and cops that are the worst and microtransaction but it has Trevor so might be worth your time i play Gta V time to time when friends ask if Gta IV is off the table but im gonna need to give this a bad review for the fact that they lost so much of Gta IV in the making of Gta V and the fact that i can't become a fat Trevor or bodybuilder Trevor i mean come on think of how great that would of been.,0.0

"pretty cool game-back then March 28, 2016I was a tryahard at this game, i played gta5 4 years straight and now I finally stopped playing. I stopped playing It because of how now you have to pay and spend allot of money, just to get everything In a single dlc. I added up all the prices for one of the dlcs which I think was the smugglers run and the in game price was around like 50-70 million for full costumizations on everything. So you'd be basically spending $500 to probably even almost $1000 in real life. Back then everything was so simple and everything was priced really good and fair, But now Rockstar has gotten really greedy. So in conclusion, Dont get this game unless you want to spend♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of real life money or grind every single day from morning to night just to only get like a few amount of money at the end.- Now November 24, 2017",1.0

"So... This game's singleplayer is really sad and gets boring even while you're playing the missions, let's not talk about after the finale. The only thing that is ""good"" to this game is the Online, but it's a greedy money-grabbing mode where if you want something nice and fun, you have to pay a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of in-game money, that you can buy with micro-transactions (Yeah, Micro-Transactions in a 60€ game, what the damn hell?!?). Now, to ""fight against modders"" (which use scripts and other things, so they're not really ""modders"", they're more a kind of ""hackers"") Take Two Interactive announced that they would take legal actions against every mod creator AND every mod user (This applies to singleplayer now too). Join the boycott against them so we can use mods in the sad singleplayer, because it's outrageous that I'm buying a ""Triple-A"" game that has a singleplayer mode that is useless and where you cannot do anything (and now you don't have DLC cars as well, thanks R*) and a multiplayer mode where you need to buy in-game money with R E A L money just to get that damn car that you want. Take Two pls fix.UPDATE : They changed their mind, so now you can use mods in singleplayer as they do not affect the multiplayer, but they also released new items in GTA Online that are way too hard to grind...

"I've been playing GTA since it was top-down, and I put in ~300 hours on the 360 version of GTA V as well.  I've since sold the Xbox, but have been maintaining and rebuilding my battlestation since then.  Needless to say, I was only SLIGHTLY miffed I had to drop another $60 to pick it up another time.I was a little apprehensive about the game being a poor port ala GTA IV, but it turned out there was no need to be.  The game runs absolutely awesome for me, the only drawback springing to mind are some long load times, despite all 60+ GB of the game being installed on an SSD.  I've noticed this mainly in multiplayer though, with an initial long load in SP then generally shorter ones thereafter.The graphics are mindblowing, and there are a lot of sliders in the options, giving you the opportunity to really fine-tune your settings and figure out what works best for you.  After minimal configuration, I'm running at a bare minimum 60FPS at all times and still marveling at just about everything in-game.  Playing with a mouse and keyboard was a simple transition for me, I was a bit concerned at first and intended to just play with a 360 controller, but instantly fell in love with mouse aiming.  GTA shooting was never the greatest but it's a lot more reliable and  entertaining with the ability to be somewhat precise.All-in-all, I definitely see another 300 hours of this in my future.  Once some mods start pouring out this game has the potential to be a longlived classic.",1.0
"At the moment I would not recommend GTA V (Certainly don't buy for full price) I have enjoyed GTA online I can't help feel it is a bit of a grind fest at times in order to own the businesses and arsenal i'd like to. I don't have lots of time to invest into this game in order to gain the money i'd like. I understand rockstar ''needs'' to sell shark cards but please don't tell me the online DLC is free when its only available to those who get deep vein thrombosis because they've sat on their a** for too long playing GTA.. Players will seek to destroy your fun online and it can be hard to play on an open online server without someone trying to destroy you and your fun with one of the many ridiculous vehicles available. Then again they have been made available. I have had fun but mainly in closed friends only servers but then you can't interact with the MC clubs ETCThere is a lot of fun to be had, I have had a lot of fun but lately it feels a grindfest and feels so much harder to get on a open server where you can complete MC missions without being trolled and feeling disappointed by the outcomes of the missions ",1.0

"My negative review is not just about Take-Two's cease and desist for the OpenIV tool but also about the lack of fun it is to play GTA Online. The campaign is absolutely marvelous and a ton of fun to play and if it was only for that I'd give it a thumb up, but R* made it quite clear in the last 4-5 years that their focus was on the Online portion of the game. That portion is extremely lackluster in my opinion since it's extremely time consuming to make any kind of money and there's very few ways of making money solo that is actually fun... I wouldn't mind it in a RP (role play) setting, since it would be expected to struggle to rise up, but the vanilla Online is far from a RP platform. The difficulty to acquire vehicles, houses and company properties without having to spend hours for a pretty unsatisfactory reward makes this component of the game a bit boring. Back in 2013 I was pretty hopeful for GTA: Online since I thought they would add multiple map extensions so it would really feel like a bigger world full of opportunities, 5 years later I'm pretty disappointed that it turned into a money grab and to make it worst, the content in GTA: Online is not available in the story mode + you can't mod it anymore, hard to give that a positive review ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.",0.0

"This game gives me the usual love hate relationship as all previous versions of GTA. The main reason is that it is a lovely world to explore BUT the controls are too much of a fight. So i am playing the controls rather then the game.Another HUGE problem is the crashes. I can play 1 to 30 minutes until i get either a bluescreen (!!!), hang or program crash. PC, software, drivers etc. are all up to date. This for a 60 euro game is unacceptable, the focus for R* needs to be the instability of the software. That being said, here are my pro's and con's:PRO- Beautiful world to explore- First person, finally!!- Great characters, Trevor rules- Missions are fun- Cars look stunningCON- Crashes crashes crashes- Too few missions- No real challange after main story- Controls....- Mulitplayer loading timeLast bit, about multiplayer, due to crashes i cannot play that, so it would be unfair to comment on the gameplay itsself.At this moment i would advice to Wait until the crashing is resolved.

The fact that GTA 5 can be seen as the best / second best selling full price game and the publichers behind it STILL wants to rob you of your own money is almost incredible.It's sad that one of, if not the greatest game of all time is being controlled by a money hungering and right out disgusting company like 2k.

Millions per year and they stop the one fun thing about singleplayer which is modding making the game better for us to play. They overprice everything in online so you buy sharkcards so they can take your money. GTA 5 HAS OFFICIALLY NOW DIED",1.0
ALRIGHT I get it you are looking at these reviews to try and see if this game is worth it and overall due to the negative reviews you are steering against it. BUT don't let these fool you the game is very good. The singleplayer is phenomenal plenty of fun to have there if you don't want to do a bit of grind for money in multiplayer which brings me to my next topic.Multiplayer it is really unfortunate how many people ARE TOXIC ♥♥♥♥. But it is ok as long as youu have like 2-6 friends playing you willl have fun regardless. If the multiplayer really isn't your style I would recomend single player but when you play always beat the game and play as much as you want THAN I would recomend downloading scripthook which is a mod menu for story only it is free and you cannot be banned it is just fun to do anything anytime and no ban like you would risk modding in multiplayerBut I guess folks this'll be the end of the review.,1.0

"Single Player campaign is amazing.  Just like all other GTA games, the single player mode is very well done, and there is a lot to do.  There is more than enough story and gameplay to justify the price alone without the Online mode.  The game runs great and is so much fun to play.  There is no denying this is one of the best games out there in quite a while.The Online mode has strong positives and very strong negatives.  It is lots of fun, plenty of different modes to try out and things to do.  The heists in my opinion are the best part of online and are tremendously fun for sure.  Just driving around with your friends is great, or doing races with stunt courses. There are many many problems with online however.  First of all everything costs a crazy amount of money, including the required buildings you need to start heists, especially the doomsday one.  There is a huge amount of hackers or modders online also.  So many that it's rare I play the game and there isn't one the lobby, or at least someone complaining about one that just left.   The modders can do any number of things like lock your character, kill you instantly from far distances, or spawn any number of vehicles, items (including money), or just random obsticles such as UFOs.  For someone that would be playing the game legit and worked for weeks to collect crates to sell, having that inventory blown up instantly by a modder would be devastating.There are a number of technical issues mostly related to online mode as well.  The time it takes to load the online lobby can be extremely long.  This includes when you're done missions or heists and go back to the open world.  I've had numerous ocasions and so has everyone i know where the lobby takes past 10 minutes to load back up, or wont load at all forcing you to ALT-F4 to quit.  In fact, the loading is so long that almost always when i'm done playing i wont wait for the game to load again, i will close it with ALT-F4.  Furthermore, the menus seems extremely delayed and are very awkward to use with mouse and keyboard, you very often dont realize you're on a certain screen when you think you are.  The online matchmaking is also very hard to understand and use.  Sometimes when you want to start a new heist/setup/mission/race you join other peoples game by mistake because there's no option to stop that.There is so many more issues with the Online mode that there's too many to list and could really go on forever.  Almost every time i play there's something that's extremely frustrating about it, purely on a technical aspect, not related to modders or other players.Saying all these faults about the game, there is no way i could not recommend it to everyone.  There is so much polish in the actual gameplay, controls, story, characters, voice acting, overall feel, and pure enjoyment in this game that it's worth playing no matter what else is wrong with it.But seriously, the modders/hackers need to stop.  Although with the price of everything online, it's not going to.",1.0

" The story mode of gta v has it's points, but some of the writing is a bit pathetic.  They could have provided a better experience for players.  Most of the gameplay does work and can be fun.  It has some weird side quests and some unusual events to experience.  Though you end up having to use a guide or a walkthrough to experience more than half of the things because too many of these events are so obscure that people couldn't find them even while trying to find the ufo. Another aspect of gta v is the online multiplayer mode.  They really did provide some good things to do online.  You can get involved with other players and play a decent version of gta with friends.  The key problem with their online though is a constant shoveling of newer better stuff to get you to spend the in game money because they don't really want you playing, the want you buying shark cards which get you in game money.  It is heavily marketed that way and can be annoying at times but is not the worst issue.  It really is just a small issue that they nearly harass you with in game coments from npcs and constant beeps from the ""phone"" about things you should be buying.  It would not really be a problem if the game was normally playable. Lately the game isn't particularly playable.  The methods they used to provide the online content leaves it vulnerable to some versions of cheating.  Because of the vulnerabilities mod creators tend to provde lots of cheats for some people to abuse the game with.  Those people start to make sure that no one else can play the game.  Rockstar does attempt to ban wave at times as they detect the cheats, and they do have a ban system in place that can permanently remove an account from playing online.  But they don't do any more than that.  Cheater takes away all your progress, well if they got detected, then they get a temporary ban first, then a permanent ban on second offense.  You on the other hand after a week of contacting support usually get some of your stuff restored, but glitches end up leaving some things inaccesible for weeks or months. Cheaters abuse everyone constantly for multiple days at a time, and Rockstar merely just lets it happen.  It may not be easy for any developer to prevent cheating, but lately I would say that Rockstar makes an effort to endorse cheating because they are not doing anything about these issues anymore.  If you want to play gta online, then play only in private sessions where you can't access the good content or meet other people that you have not already made friends with.  In other words, until you see proof that Rockstar has done something about the cheating, don't play gta online.",1.0

The map is  small like IV.The races have a 'cheat' for the main driving character which makes it too easy.  Since the driving and the driving routes are the best of the series it gets a thumbs up.

The game was fun, online was massive, the story was immersive, and the graphics took GTA to a new level. I loved playing with my friends through missions and just screwing around with each other in freeplay. Alas, our fun was cut short when Rockstar decided that instead of having fun and be coming successful, the player with either have to spend eternity grinding or BUY THEIR GOD FORSAKEN SHARK CARDS. Now, online is riddled with hackers and cheaters. Rockstar does not care about the players. They keep raising prices on new items. They constantly see glitches in their game and just do not fix them. GTA V is ruined.It's a shame too, because I loved the single player. I had tons of fun playing through the story and actually getting 100% completion. Everything about the story was fun- the game took GTA where it had never been before. Also, easter eggs and allusions foretold of great dlc to come... Whelp, it is not happening. Rockstar doesn't give a damn and decided that those shark cards were the way to go.In conclsuion, buy this game if it is on sale for less than $30. Anything more than that is not worth it.

"One of the top five most sold games in the world and they only wanted more. They couldn't handle not selling enough shark cards, but its not like they didn't sell, they did, and they sold so much they completely gave up on any future single player content. They focused on multiplayer only content with extremely high priced objects in-game, which to afford you need to buy shark cards. They didn't even bother to add some of the multiplayer content into the single player. So to keep singleplayer fun and intersting, if you're not a multiplayer kind of person, you'd need to mod the game using OpenIV, they saw this as ""taking away from the multiplayer experience"" and they thought that they were not monetizing their games enough. They ordered a cease and desist against the OpenIV team. If they think this game is worth more than $60, they are wrong. Don't let them step on us anymore than they already have. They are saying ""You can't modify your game that you bought, we need more money from you, so you are going to buy our shark cards"". If Take Two doesnt stop being greedy and manipulting I will never purchase any more of their products and will openly and activly oppose them. I used to love this game. When it was first released it felt like someone had cared about the product they were making. Now it just feels like they are panhandling and pushing out shallow content. Shame on you Take Two.",1.0

"I purchased this game around March of 2016. Since then I had a great time playing GTA Online as well as the storymode. It easily became my most favorite game in my library. Unfortunately, Rockstar royally screwed up because I, in addition to several other players apparently, had legitimate money removed from my account that I know for a fact wasn't hacked or modded into the game. I've never recieved any money drops from any modder or hacker, and I monitor my bank account constantly, ESPECIALLY as of recent because I was saving up for the MOC in gunrunning. A couple of days ago I come to find that my bank account is cut in half when they removed 687K dollars from around 1.3-1.4 million dollars. What's the point of playing if any money earned can be taken away without a second thought?It's a shame because now I can no longer play in peace. It is a bit comforting to know that this isn't just an isolated incident too, because then Rockstar might actually pay attention to their utter screw up. I definitely can't recommend anyone getting this game because of this huge issue in GTA Online. You could still buy it for the singleplayer campaign, and it's a great game in that respect, but Rockstar screwed up big time, and I hope they correct themselves from here on out.",1.0

"Well after 100 days of my life spent playing this (yes nearly 2400 hours) I'd like to add a few words. Out of that time only 2 hours was spent online and that was enough for me, I don't think I need to expand on the reasons for that. I've played the story through a couple of times doing the scores different ways and different endings to the main story, I've added a few mods and now only have three installed - Police everywhere, No Helicopters and Insane driving maxed out. What I get is an absolute blast of comedy - shootouts, pile-ups, accidents, ped wipouts, fighting, cop chases that can last for hours, gang bashing, incite cop/gang shootouts, etc etc. always a situation that can be exploited for entertainment. With the mods, doing the missions adds another dimension, for instance driving to a specific location and you can get taken out by other vehicles and of course the police usually get involved.I'm no reviewer, but can honestly say that in twenty five years of playing games, no other has ever held my attention for so long, with the glorious visuals, attention to detail, entertainment, immersion, fun and comedy. Rockstar created a masterpiece here. Buy it, install some mods, forget Online...have a blast.",1.0

You have LOADS of content within the online not just cars and weapons, but associations, mc clubs, missions and more.Online is really good and very funny to play.. well at times. You will find hackers, modders or just toxic people, which will unbalance and bother your gameplay. Finally, uses p2p connections so you will get unstable or disconnected. A lot.",1.0
"In short:Campaign mode - well worth it. The game itself is incredible even nearly 5 years after being published, has a vast open world that will keep giving after hundreds of hours of gameplay. I currently have 100 hours on record, and still feel like I've nearly begun playing. The storyline is brilliant, missions that are unrivaled by V's predecessors. The little details will surprise you over and over again, the places you can find Mike Trevor and Franklin at, the diallogues that you will wait to be over with even though you have basically reached your destination. The game really is a gem, and it's well worth the money.Why it's currently got lots of negative reviews is well explained by the people who put them.The online mode is... Horrendous. I guarantee you, half the time in online you'll spend enjoying it and using the most of it - it has even more missions, great stunt races, heists, even more things to do than in story mode. However, the other half the time spent (and I'm not even kidding, if you're lucky it will be less than 50% of the time) will be either on loading screens to and from sessions, disconnecting from sessions, which will make it very frustrating if you are looking to buy the top vehicles, a yacht, or even a decent property that would be only half a million. It will take you ages just because of it. On some occasions, I spend up to 2 hours in this game trying to do a single heist, but being unable to because of people disconnecting (then having to do the loading screen again), and only get to spend 30 minutes out of it playing the game itself. Also, the community is beginning to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ You will need to be coordinated most of the time (and have a great knowledge in English, that most people seem to neglect), and it's really hard once a Russian 13 year olds join you in your missions. (don't mean to be racist, nearly all the kids in this game will be the same - spoiled brats. Make them non-english speaking spoiled brats in an English game - a +18 one... You won't have a good time.)So should you or should you not buy this game?Absolutely. Grand Theft Auto V is a piece of art that you really need to experience. It will provide you with lots of hours of pure fun and enjoyment if you're gonna stick with the exploring and storyline. You will feel the game paying off in the first 5-10 hours of playing.However, unless you have a *really* good internet, you're near to wherever the servers are, and have some real-life friends you think you can enjoy the online part with - I don't think you should feel much of the Online mode. In years time, the servers have (from what I could feel) only gotten worse, which is an indicator they probably won't do much about it any time soon (if ever, that is.) You shouldn't completely neglect it, but do have low expectations on it. You'll either have quite a fun time, or quite a frustrating one - the later mostly. Unless you have A LOT of the time in your hands, don't expect to grind much.And grinding is not an important part of the game. There is literally so much to do, don't let the frustrating online mode occasionally stop you in it.TLDR;Online - not worth. If you're someone who will appreciate the online most of the time, this isn't a game for you.Offline - must-buy. Details, the story, the message it sends etc. Enjoy it.",1.0

So yes, it's a negative review and is not acceptable considering the money they have made from this and the amount of time it has been out.",1.0

"Long story short, after over 600 hours of gameplay (most of which is online, my character was around level 214), I get suspended for no discernable reason and my character reset. November 8th: Me and a few friends decided to try the new Deadline game mode after messing around in a private free mode lobby for a while. We do this, and when were done, I got sent in to a public game for about a minute before I quit the game. Approximately two hours later, I get an email saying my account broke the EULA and terms of service, and I have been suspended for 30 days and my stats reset. Why? I have never once cheated/hacked/modified my game files. If I had to guess, there was probably a hacker in the public game I was in, and I was in just long enough to get dragged along with him. All the horror stories about getting suspended are true, I found out. I tried contacting support and got a copy/paste response about how the ban system works. My friend also contacted them and got a name for me to ask for, even going to the length of calling their support hotline and speaking to a (rather cocky) employee who told him that I would have to call (the entire call was also recorded). It was late at night at the time I heard about it so instead of calling, I sent in another ticket explaining in detail what happened, and mentioned his ticket number and the persons name...same response. Thanks Rockstar for taking over 600 hours of gameplay away from me for no real reason. I loved GTA Online, but after this, I am never buying any of your products again.My boyfriend and another friend of mine made videos on it if anyone is curious.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2_AGmG9EvoIhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwuH9JHPdpI",1.0

On the PS4 and PS3 I played an hour then got bored, but with the PC version there's so much more things to do and see, and everything just looks amazing.

" The story mode of gta v has it's points, but some of the writing is a bit pathetic.  They could have provided a better experience for players.  Most of the gameplay does work and can be fun.  It has some weird side quests and some unusual events to experience.  Though you end up having to use a guide or a walkthrough to experience more than half of the things because too many of these events are so obscure that people couldn't find them even while trying to find the ufo. Another aspect of gta v is the online multiplayer mode.  They really did provide some good things to do online.  You can get involved with other players and play a decent version of gta with friends.  The key problem with their online though is a constant shoveling of newer better stuff to get you to spend the in game money because they don't really want you playing, the want you buying shark cards which get you in game money.  It is heavily marketed that way and can be annoying at times but is not the worst issue.  It really is just a small issue that they nearly harass you with in game coments from npcs and constant beeps from the ""phone"" about things you should be buying.  It would not really be a problem if the game was normally playable. Lately the game isn't particularly playable.  The methods they used to provide the online content leaves it vulnerable to some versions of cheating.  Because of the vulnerabilities mod creators tend to provde lots of cheats for some people to abuse the game with.  Those people start to make sure that no one else can play the game.  Rockstar does attempt to ban wave at times as they detect the cheats, and they do have a ban system in place that can permanently remove an account from playing online.  But they don't do any more than that.  Cheater takes away all your progress, well if they got detected, then they get a temporary ban first, then a permanent ban on second offense.  You on the other hand after a week of contacting support usually get some of your stuff restored, but glitches end up leaving some things inaccesible for weeks or months. Cheaters abuse everyone constantly for multiple days at a time, and Rockstar merely just lets it happen.  It may not be easy for any developer to prevent cheating, but lately I would say that Rockstar makes an effort to endorse cheating because they are not doing anything about these issues anymore.  If you want to play gta online, then play only in private sessions where you can't access the good content or meet other people that you have not already made friends with.  In other words, until you see proof that Rockstar has done something about the cheating, don't play gta online.",1.0
"They just removed the best part of this game, the mod community (single player) by going after single player mod tools and deeming them illegal (after R* encouraging users to use them at that). GTA used to be an instant buy for me, I purchased it for pc even after already owning it on ps3 and I didn't do it for the graphics, i did it for the mods. I will not be purchasing future gta titles or any other take two title for that matter unless this decision is reversed.",1.0

"  . <3 +1Originally posted by TlabiBiskitts:Open Letter from the Community Regarding the State of Public OnlineYour approach to handling modders is unforgivable.Modders have nearly limitless power:- They can not be kicked- They can hide their name- They can bypass reports- They can spawn anything they can wish for- Passive mode can not protect us- They can frame innocent players for modding- They can crash our games at will- They can remove weapons and ammo from players- They can spoil player's early game experience and unbalance gameplay by money spamming.As a result, the community has become toxic; ever player is paranoid and nervous, making unique social interactions and community events extremely rare and often sabotaged. This needs to be your top priority.The most hyped portion of your game is being ruined. Sabotaged for loyal fans who waited patiently for years for the PC release or loved the game so much the first time around they wanted to buy it again, at full price. We don't want content right now, Rockstar, we want a fair game experience. We need the modder issue dealt with. We love your games, your profits say that better than I ever could, so please do right by your loyal fans. Sincerely,The GTA Community",1.0

"I am going to give my honest opinion. I never really cared for really any kind of modding in this game (singleplayer or rp servers). I know that take two has messed up if that wasn't obvious from all the other 99% of reviews. I know it's not because of taking Opev VI was asked to stop, it's the reason, from what I know there wasn't any reason to make Open VI stop. However you should not be getting mad about something that is not even really meant to be in the game in the first place. This does make me want to try an RP server or mod in singleplayer a bit more. I just wish all these reviews were about the base game, which they should be. About the base game: The start is always the hardest part about most games, especially this one. All you have to do is grind and find ways to make money and have fun at the same time. Modders in multiplayer are a problem, but you can just find a new session.I find this game to be somewhat addictive when you are always making objectives for yourself about what thing you want next (car, tank, office building, etc).Trolls in multiplayer can sometimes give you a laugh, but the ones who just shoot you out of your car for no reason kinda ruin the fun sometimes.This is my honest opinion so far about this game and what has happened in the GTA V Modding community",1.0

"TL;DR: Online is fun for 30 hours max, after that you need to grind or be rich. Singleplayer is really fun.I will preface with this: I enjoy the game, and the singleplayer is excellent. However, the main catalyst for rage on my part and one of the main selling points of this game is the online. My salt will be focused to bolster the claims and cries by other like minded gamers. When I say rage, I do not mean ""REEEE HACKER!"" I know I am awful at this game. The online is a grind, and not a very short one. It is a very arduous as well as tedious journey to the top of the food chain. Now, you could either find a community to guide you there and make it somewhat bearable, however in this eventuality you end up grinding the same heist over and over again, close to five times a day to get anywhere. The alternatives include freeroam activities (which could be fun, more on that later) or doing missions with randoms, which in this game happen to for the most part be awful. I mean straight garbage. Your fourth and quite frankly final option if you hope to have fun after the first 30 hours of online (not incluiding singleplayer), you will purchase shark cards. IRL money to buy IG money. People will say this is optional, so it doesnt affect me. Keep in mind other people play this game, and opt to purchase the aforementioned cards, then proceed to purchase weapons and vehicles that can ruin your life.I neglected to divulge to you the content of these freeroam missions, so here goes. You can buy and office or biker clubhosue from which to stage your operation as either a luxury vehicle exporter and wholeseller of all manner of illicit merchandise, or a biker gang pushing drugs and running jobs as guns for hire. Either costs literal millions, close to 2mil to actually start earning anything exporting and around 200k for biker gangs, at least for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ low end missions. This sounds quite fun, and it is. For an hour apiece. Then it becomes boring, repetitive and easily exploitable. Oh, and might I add, you need to be in a public session, leaving yourself vulnerable to the *friendly* community of GTAV. How lovely. Now, you have established your presence and then begin to recieve numerous unrelenting calls about a new hangar, how this can expand your empire even further. Or, you see that you can purchase a bunker. You opt for either one, and lo and behold, same crap. Grind out boring, repetitive missions while you are being viciously maueld by various aircraft and the like. What you could do, is decide to cut your connection and quickly reconnect it in order to force yourself to be kicked from an open session into a closed solo session that counts as a public session. Simple exploit #1. You are welcome. Whats so bad about this? Well, it gets even more repetitive, though significantly less frustrating. Almost forgot, you could run monotonous jobs and missions that earn you meager cash rewards, and are simply difficult if you do not have the money to purchase good vehicles and missions. That and nobody plays anything. Good luck finding people.Edit: words",1.0

"a brilliant single player, a very very very good multiplayer, marred by server issued and stupid DRM.

"Some points about this gameGTA5-freaking long storyline-you can possessed 3 characters-exciting storyline-side missions (nvr planned to complete it)GTA Online-Hogging the whole day on Character Customization-I dunno wat is passive mode-someobody tried to kill me-but i shot him in the car-he came back and took his revenge.-Server full of people speaking Russian, Indian and China and some other languages and kids scolding profanities -Activated passive mode, and no one kills me-start numerous of heist-earn big money and wat u can spent on? - Cars, Cars mod, boats, Planes, Helicopter and tanks., food, outfits, throw money at stripper, buy drinks, pay stripper to dance for u, Houses, Guns, armor, Heist payment etc etc-Various missions like Steal the drug deal, steal cars, destroy cars and trucks, defend ur friends.-U need friends for dis, coz i played with some strangers, some erh perhaps trying to screw up ur mission and spent 1 hour for playing for nth. I guess i have trust issues with strangers-Basically u can do almost anything in this open world mapThe bad is sometimes the server is full or some other issues they will bring u to offline or storyline mode, is quite understandable as millions of players are online. But in gTA Heist, u have Team lives count and once it runs out, game over. There is no such thing in team revival in GTA if u played payday, l4d etc etc. U must get use to driving, flying and shooting and taking necessary cover. Hackers? Yup they still have hackers, i occurred a guy is total invisible and just shoot frm above, i was like, wtf? and go ard killing ppl, i understand some put a bad review just becoz of price, honestly this game do made a tremendous breakthru throughout game history, the price did set the reasonable range, but still hope for steam sales for this game in order to convince my friends to buy . But overall if u have friends, go for it and go to private servers and yes, create a crew, and i hope rockstar can create new heists and missions and cars and guns lol",0.0

"Grand Theft Auto V in my opinion is an important milestone in the evolution of video games. It's also important to point out that this game is centered around having fun. Fun things to do in real life, is fun to do in this game. The mechanics are deep and varied, allowing you to do things I'd doubt the devs even thought of. The aesthetic of the game is consistent and polished. You always get the 'Los Santos' vibe, from the parodical nature of the game's media, to the nostalgic hollywood-esque music scores that play in important/exciting events. The game forces you into immersion in ways I haven't seen other dev's than Rockstar do, for example in Online: To buy stuff like cars, you have to browse the in-game web using your in-game phone. Things like these really help you get deeper into the world.",1.0

"A big part of a game is the community. A good community equals a good game, and a bad community equals a bad game. the overall community in GTA Online is good, but Rockstar has given too much power to a single person, allowing them to ban whoever they want, effectively slowly turning the good community into a bad one. In fact, I was banned very recently when an angry player reported me. It was either that or a modder gave me guns, which I did not ask for. The probelem with GTA is that the innocents get punished and the hackers and salty community get off scot-free. This equals for a bad game that's progressively getting worse.

I've been playing it since it came out in 2013. The singleplayer is fun, when you play you can pretend you're a hitman and just kill people. Or you can download mods that expand this game to be several more hours, although you can't usually play multliplayer with mods installed so you usually have to delete the mod files if you do want to play online.

"I've been playing GTA since it was top-down, and I put in ~300 hours on the 360 version of GTA V as well.  I've since sold the Xbox, but have been maintaining and rebuilding my battlestation since then.  Needless to say, I was only SLIGHTLY miffed I had to drop another $60 to pick it up another time.I was a little apprehensive about the game being a poor port ala GTA IV, but it turned out there was no need to be.  The game runs absolutely awesome for me, the only drawback springing to mind are some long load times, despite all 60+ GB of the game being installed on an SSD.  I've noticed this mainly in multiplayer though, with an initial long load in SP then generally shorter ones thereafter.The graphics are mindblowing, and there are a lot of sliders in the options, giving you the opportunity to really fine-tune your settings and figure out what works best for you.  After minimal configuration, I'm running at a bare minimum 60FPS at all times and still marveling at just about everything in-game.  Playing with a mouse and keyboard was a simple transition for me, I was a bit concerned at first and intended to just play with a 360 controller, but instantly fell in love with mouse aiming.  GTA shooting was never the greatest but it's a lot more reliable and  entertaining with the ability to be somewhat precise.All-in-all, I definitely see another 300 hours of this in my future.  Once some mods start pouring out this game has the potential to be a longlived classic.",1.0
"This review is for GTA ONLINEI want to leave good feedback on this game for the quality of the single player but unfortunately the online has left me sour.  GTA online is a clunky mess of hackers, griefers, and what seems to be continous load screens between missions and trying to party with with crew members.  They make it incredibly hard to start off for new players.  Most existing players have so much money and replenished ammo and guns that make it nearly impossible to counter them.  When griefing gets too serious, you can opt in for passive mode that makes you a ghost so you cant crash or interact with other players.  There are ways to still grief a player while he is in passive mode.  You can shoot out store clerks from anything they try to go into or shoot out the tires of any car they are trying to enter.  A lot of the missions require team work to complete to make any decent money.  Without the missions there are small objectives you can complete in free mode that give you petty cash.  With all this being said, without a group of friends to play with, the online community is very toxic and childish.    The best option to get away from the crappy lobbies is to join a new session.  From the several online hours I put in so far, I feel like I have entered that loading screen enough for a month of gameplay from joining new sessions trying to find a decent non toxic lobby.  The grouping system ""crew"" is the clunky part i spoke about.  They make it very confusing just trying to play with a friend.  If all these problems pertain to you, don't worry you can just spend real money or GTA online cash to overpower other players trying to earn the cash in game.  PAY TO WIN!  There needs to be an online matchmaking system that matches you with players based on the money you have spent and what is in your bank.  The only saving grace this game has is the incredible Story mode and voice acting.  Rockstar has never failed by that.  I can definiely say that I am enjoying the single player 10X more than online.",1.0

"Wow, finally ready to submit a review 890 game hours later...   For a game that has so much potential, Rockstar has wasted customer's time and money in making GTA Online more about PvP. I used to see it as a great overall open-world ""build your empire"" semi-realistic simulator, but now with rocket-flying missile-shooting bikes, off-radar stealth helis, flying DeLoreans shooting missiles... it's honestly just become stupid as he**.  Too easy for some chump to steal a Laser (faster airplane [jet] in the game) and troll on random people, flying faster than heatsinking missiles albeit susceptible to FMJ/explosive rounds. It's just mahem.    I guess TBH, I used to mainly play the heists to make money and force 4-player co-op player, but people get killed easy over and over and don't listen to tips and suggestions. If I'm lucky enough to get 3 or 4 players to work for me as a CEO or Motorcycle Club owner, we just got trolled nevertheless and easily get 5-10 hour jobs blown up like it's nothing.   Again, the game has amazing potential. Patching up the game to reduce the constant boat-load of hackers and taking away the excessive weaponary is a start.    Rockstar, why do you still sell this game full price? Greedy jerks. Starter packs and shark cards don't get you that much in game... not with all the hacking and insane weapons and weaponize vehicles folks have.",1.0

"Let’s make this clear. This is about GTA online and it is about a specific glitch. This review doesn’t affect single player BUT can tell you a lot about the developers and online mode. So i have been playing a lot of online recently. Few days ago, a new dlc was announced. At that time i had 5 mil dollars so i had enough to buy some basic things in the new dlc. But suddenly Rockstar decided to f##k me over and took away 3 mil dollars for no f#cking reason. Legit earned money, hours of burning grinding were removed. So i decided to contact support i though that Rockstar anti cheat system is just broken and they will get me my money back. But guess what? Rockstar ♥♥♥♥ed me over again. they said that they have removed illegally earned money from my account. So what the f#uck do u mean by illegally earned money? Playing the game is now illegal? you deiced to f#uck me over right before the dlc and you are lying about illegaly earned money. Now i have to admit that i did unfortunately received somewhere around a mil dollars from a Modder. This IS not MY fault. This is rock starts fault that modders are ruining my gaming experience in their game. I did receive around 1 mil. Modder teleported all players and started dropping money, i tried not to pick it up but i wasn’t able to move (Modder blocked us). So it was ok if Rockstar would remove 1 mil dollars from me its fine BUT Rockstar didn’t remove 1 mil. They removed 3.3 million. Legit 2.3 million earned money. How does that make any f#cking since?

I wasn't a big fan on online mode since I saw it as nothing but a pointless grind, sure the heist update was fun, but that was probably one of the best updates for online, if not the best update for online. And that was over 2 years ago. There was no reason to remove mods, Take Two.

"If your looking for a review on this game you've come to the wrong place, but if your looking for an outstanding pie recipe you've come to the right place.Ingredients:1. 6 tablespoons unsalted butter2. 1/2 cup white sugar3. 1/2 cup brown sugar4. 1/4 cup water5. 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon6. 1 pinch salt7. 5 apples - peeled, cored and sliced8. 1 pastry for double-crust pie Directions:1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside.3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices.4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal.5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust.6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes. Allow to cool completely before slicingBut seriously, I love this game!",1.0

Love this game and love every minute of it. Got it for my playstation and it was worth buying it once again to play with friends! 100% recommend this game and any GTA game to be honest <3The only thing I dislike about GTA online is the hackers etc.Besides that.. if you have a large group of friends of 4-5 players or more it could be fun to make a private server for a better online experience,1.0

"GTA perfected.Positive:+ Great world, very belieavable, detailed, polished and alive !+ Stories - so many stories and characters that are unique and relatable+ Missions - if you played GTA before, you will feel like at home+ Graphics - game models are very detailed with excellent animations.

"Let me preface this review by saying that, in no way, is your experience of GTA going to be ruined by the option of buying shark cards. Shark cards are just useless things you can buy for a little boost if you want to, but are nearly useless and a waste of money. Money that you can easily earn through doing heists and adversary modes.Now that that's out of the way, let me list some pros and cons.Pros (single player):Extremely well put together ✔Voice acting is incredible (they even got real gang members to voice some of the in game gang members) ✔Consistent storyline, one that makes you feel like it's almost real and happening right now. ✔Immersive characters. I honestly felt oddly attached to each character by the end of the story. ✔Cons (single player): Sometimes (kind of rarely) AI may glitch out during a mission and cause a mission failure. ✖Saving the game can be very clunky and odd to do at some points. ✖Pros (Multiplayer):Very very fun with friends, and fun making new ones too. ✔Easy to pick up and learn, you really can't be outmatched by a high level player, as long as you're skilled and have a gun. ✔Very fun and rewarding heists. The most recent heists to come out, the doomsday heist, was extremely fun in my opinion and really showed what R* can do with this heist concept. ✔Easy to level up and earn cash if you're doing heists and adversary modes often. ✔Endless replayability. ✔Cons (multiplayer):Sometimes hackers can be a bother, whether it be by turning on god mode and slumping you, or dropping unwanted cash on you. This can really just be avoiding by joining a new session. ✖Barely any cash can be made unless you're doing heists, adversary modes, and running supplies, so if you're planning on hopping into online and getting some good cars and stuff instantly, you might wanna be ready to grind a little. ✖Pros (general):Beautifully put together world, amazing graphics and attention to detail. ✔You don't need a great computer to run it. I used to have an AMD Radeon 6670 (kinda eh gpu) and could run this game at medium 30-40 fps. ✔Gunplay, driving, and flying mechanics and controls are smooth and responsive. ✔Cons (general):Sometimes walking and climbing mechanics can be odd, but that's easily overlooked and not that big of a deal. ✔My final review:Single player: 9.5/10Multiplayer: 8.5/10Gameplay mechanics: 9/10Graphics: 10/10 (it's a 2013 game that looks better than some 2017 games ffs)Replayability: 10/10Over all, this game has insane amounts of things to do In it, and if this game was being sold standard edition for 90$ I would happily buy it. Free dlc being released every so often is just icing on the cake too. So much customization and freedom in this beautiful looking game makes it worth so much more than it's priced at.",1.0

"This game is plagued by a horrible community, poor mechanics, poor interface, and the matchmaking system is so ridiculous you'll spend more time loading and waiting for a game online than you will actually playing this game. Because of this, the game is reduced to simple pvp action(with little to no gain), or going it solo in private rooms. Rockstar should be sued for damages so that no other company puts out this kind of garbage again.Don't make a game ridiculously hard to play. Design your game to be player freindly. Sixty bucks for this piece of contrived doo-doo is a joke- I hate i paid that kind of money for this, but at least i'll never buy another one of their games.Can't get anyone for Heists. Can't reliably play without a massive amount of bull just to accomplish anything worthwhile. Game is designed to sell cards by keeping player from making any real money in game. It's all business model with very little to offer on the consumer end. You'll never get your money's worth out of this game- it was designed from the start to be a horrible time sink with little reward and someone should be castrated for that.after 202 hours of trying to like this game it has become painfully obvious that Rockstar has no intention of addressing anything outside profit margin - Don't reward them with a purchase.",0.0
"Ima click not recommended, just because I know everyone else will say recommend, and yes, single player is a fantastic game, however, apes could do a better job on the online mode. 5+ minutes loading screens, which btw you need to go through every other 5 minutes because of the worst matchmaking system I have ever seen in a game, which means that it's practically impossible to start a mission without being invited to one. Bugs and glitches galore (and, after a quick google search, I found that most of which have been in the game for a very long time, so maybe rather than giving us more cars every month that that add zero substance to the game, maybe fix all the existing issues and glitches?!). Oh, and when you do actually manage to get into a heist/race or whatever, be ready to be sat in stone cold last or spend most of your time respawning because, until you grind for hours you're going to be much slower/easier to kill/do much less damage than everyone else in the game. If you have a group of friends that you can set up your own private server with then, I can see this being ok as an online game, but soloing is one of the most boring experiences, which is such a shame because I genuinely believe this could such an awesome oniline game if it was done properly!

"So far (178 hours, only about 10 of it was actually spent on SP), I've gotten two characters to roughly level 30, and have completed my first Heist (Fleeca) on both of them, as well as done Act 1 of the Doomsday Heist As a crew member and I've yet to feel where the ""Grind"" comes from.Limited time: Do the Treasure Hunt, collect the Double-Action Revolver (One of the best* pistols in the game) and get 50 headshots on NPC's and you'll get GTA$250,000 which is well over enough to get a high-end apartment to start your first Heist.*: Subjectively the best, this is my opinion since it does the second-highest amount of damage with a decent firerate with a trade-off of holding only six rounds.",1.0

"I played through the story and thought it was merely alright, though the gameplay was exceptional.  While the missions were fantastic, the story didn't hit it's mark with me.  None of the main characters (you have three) were as relatable as CJ from San Andreas.  Without a strong lead it's hard to care.  What kept me going was the sheer amount of interesting things to do: from base jumping to hunting, to you name it.  I think the last 50 hours or so of game time for me were just driving fast, listening to music, occasionally causing chaos.  That's says a lot.  The game mechanics, visuals, and production are so spot-on that doing nothing in particular is still fun and interesting.Essential.Edit:  GTA Online is initially fun but hackers are still rampant and the community is probably the most toxic of any game I've ever played.  I recently had my game glitched and crashed by another player.  I have no idea how they did it.  Hackers will just mess with you.  I haven't seen it recently but hackers used to shoot money at you causing R* to ban you since you gained money too quickly.  Considering the story and crime theme, the game itself is basically attracting A-hole types.  Trolls, in other words.  Since the community is comprised of so many people with these personalities, I really don't expect to play GTA Online in much further depth.  Just something to consider.  Great game otherwise.",1.0

"I usually dont write any reviews, and if I do, I stick to positive ones - however, in this case, no matter how painful it is, I have to break a habit.Despite all the things that could make this game fantastic, the following three factors steal all fun from it, leaving only bad memories.    A legion of modders on the loose,    Powerless neglecting and indifferent ""support"" from Rockstar,    and really -I mean REALLY- long loading times.In this order.While the game has breathtaking graphics, fun game mechanics, good humour, and always something to do for endgame, it has zero control over cheaters/modders due to its P2P nature.You are defenseless against cheating people with mod menus. With a single keystroke they can:    explode you    stuck bulky or flaming items permanently on you which persist until you restart game    put persistent objects in the game world (like cages around you)    take control of your vehicle    become invisible and/or invulnerable    teleport you or themselves around the map or miles above the air    use the new orbital cannon and destroy anything at will    kill you even in passive mode by becoming invulnerable, getting a 5 star police wanted level, and teleporting on you constantly so when NPCs shooting them, they will hit you instead.Just to name a few, but the list goes on and expands every passing day.Why not reporting modders? Trust me I did. A lot of them. Heck, I even reported when I got modded money - Avoiding to spend it for months, having trouble to keep track of the amount of cash I can safely use.In the rare occurences Rockstar answered at all, it was always generic ""please be patient"", and ""we are actively doing this and that"" or ""you can report modders on x forums"" - with no actual action or effect seemed to follow.In fact, modders are so numerous, that when publisher Take-Two Interactive started a ""cease-and-desist"" order against the creator of OpenIV, a long-standing modding tool for Grand Theft Auto 5, it's users started to give so many negative reviews on steam, that Rockstar asked them to back off.They stated: “Rockstar Games believes in reasonable fan creativity, and, in particular, wants creators to showcase their passion for our games,” which would be fair enough, if they were able to monitor or control if this mods effect single player mode (which is ok), or online (which interferes other player's fun). But they aren't.There is an option to play online in invite-only sessions (this would solve all the problems with modders) but Rockstar disabled the best gameplay options in this mode. There were petitions in the past, but nothing seemed to change.You could say ok. Let's just leave the problematic session, and find another. I did - countless times. Nowdays that's almost impossible. 95% of the sessions has at least 1 modder, or if hasn't, it will in about 20-30 mins.And with the brutal (sometimes 5-10 mins!) loading times just to get another session, thats propably just as bad as the previous one it's not a temtpting option either.There would be a solution (enable all gameplay mechanics in invite only sessions) but as I see now, Rockstar neglects its clean playerbase. I dont know, maybe we are in minority now (?) The only way left for me to protest is a negative review, and staying away from their titles as long as they wont change their politics. Until then, i think the next title would be less misleading: GMA 6 (Grand Modder Auto 6)",1.0

"Don't waste your money, gentlemen. Download the game via torrent or somehow and enjoy.Only reason to buy this game for me was multiplayer and here my opinion about it. But in fact it's dead. Low online, lots of lags/disconnects, etc.You mostly can't find a normal team for a heist, sometimes because of noobs (it's okay for gta if 1lvl joining a party of 100lvls randomly, just for example), but mostly because of low online i mentioned earlier. You will sit about 30min and wait for last player or for any player. And you won't be able to minimize the game, because you will be kicked for inactivity (even for 2mins). Noobs will fail your missions and you will replay it again and again. Cheaters in free mode will spam explosions, crash your game, spawn tons of different♥♥♥♥♥♥(like ferris wheel, buildings or plains) on you or steal all your weapons when you attack them.A big world with nothing to explore or mostly to do (only multiplayer one). Everything is boring and predictable.Developers put their large ""body part"" on multiplayer, its anticheat, its optimization (not of whole gta v, cause it's okay). They mostly add some new useless crap like cars, clothes, flats. But all of these... it's nothing, when cheater says you ""I will crash your game"" and Bam! you're on your desktop with ""GTAV.exe not responding"". The game is too lagged for pvp as well as it's too lagged for normal races.I'm 140lvl and i got everything i wanted.

"This game is great both single player and multi player. The storyline is excellent and very interesting and has various vehicles and weapons to use and unlock once you've finished, chances are you've missed something so just cruising around might open up missions you missed. The online is fun if you ignore the hackers and cheaters, although because of this the free roam is more popular than the actual jobs so to play the story elements of multiplayer like heists, you'll need a lot of patience.

The best GTA experience I ever had.,1.0
"We had fun in GTA Online before my friend got banned out of nowhere.Yeah, the public playerbase was pretty bad, and the business model was scummy, but truth be told, my overall experience was great.Playing mostly on private servers, my group of friends and I built characters from nothing together. As we made money, playing stupidly-fun minigames and going on deathmatch rampages, we created our characters’ lore. Buying new outfits, houses, and cars, we created the personalities and relationships between our characters. From the first convenience store robberies we committed to the “hard mode” heists we tried over and over to beat, everything we did spawned stories of our virtual lives.After 140+ hours of glorious, stupid fun, we took about a month’s hiatus. We played a few other group-based games, such as ESO and Don’t Starve Together, but we ended up feeling inclined to reunite our virtual characters in GTA Online. After this time away, we were ready to have some more fun, reuniting in a game that brought us all closer together as a group.That was until one of us logged on, saw that they had been suspended for 30 days, and read that their character had been completely reset.Why was our friend banned? Who knows. Based on what I’ve read (and we’ve been studying into it for hours in hopes of getting our friend's character back), there’s no hope. Rockstar’s employed some sort of algorithm that ends up banning both guilty hackers and innocent players alike out of nowhere, with no distinction. I’m not going to lie, when we went onto public servers we frequently met hackers. The issue is that my friend wasn’t one of them.“You have violated the EULA,” the suspension email states, “this decision is final.”Rockstar, you know how to make a really good game - Red Dead Redemption and both Grand Theft Auto 4 & 5 were excellent in single-player - but I can’t support this blatant lack of care for supporting your online players. 60 dollars and 140+ hours just went down the drain, because your robot randomly banned our friend, you won’t say why, and none of your “support” staff (if they even exist) care to respond to any players in the same situation.I won’t support this bafflingly unprofessional treatment of GTA Online’s playerbase.=====Basically, single player is great. Online can be as well, but good luck not getting suspended or banned out of nowhere, for no reason. You won’t know why you were banned. You won’t get support. You’ll lose time and money. And Rockstar won’t even care.",1.0
"I used to enjoy GTA 5, but as time went on it got ♥♥♥♥♥ier and ♥♥♥♥♥ier.

"Great game. Worth every penny of the $30 bucks I spent on it for half off.-The story is to die for, that's an endgame pun. Three main characters, each very interesting and flawed.-The vehicles are fun to drive/fly/sail and the cars are extremely customizable.-Gunplay is entertaining, firearms are customizable. Enemies are difficult.-Online is only truly enjoyable with friends, imo. And there's microtransactions in it soooo that's pretty dumb.-Rockstar does an excellent job making fun of every American stereotype. Their satire is the best.-Graphics are pretty nice and the game is well-optimized. However, in some sessions, parts of the map will only render   several seconds after I travel over them, followed by some stuttering. Kinda annoying, but it eventually stops.-Two stock markets that allow you to become a billionaire if you hold off on Lester's assassinations.-First-person is an EXCELLENT addition. Not the best first person experience I've had, but great to have.-There is a mini-Internet inside the game. Online stores, social media, lotta fun stuff to browse.-After playing on the Xbox 360 for 3 years at 720p 30fps, the PC port blows me away.Gets a big thumbs up from me.

"I've been playing GTA V since it's launch back in 2013. The single player, as expected is just as good as it was then.The Multiplayer is quite possibly the worst multiplayer I have ever experienced in a video game. The microtransactions in this game are far worse than anything EA has ever tried to pull. EA pulled the loot box stunt, and got totally♥♥♥♥♥♥on for doing so. Rockstar? No one even cares. With GTA's microtransactions, you are TOTALLY being ripped off. Many things in this game cost well over 10 million dollars, which if you don't want to grind for hours, will cost you almost 200 US dollars, which I think is terrible. Even the simplest things, like a decent supercar can cost a million, which with the nerfs to heists and normal missions, is a complete chore to play through.If you're looking for a solid single player experience, then sure it's a good game. It's fun, but almost the exact same as the original Xbox 360/PS3 versions with a shiny coat of paintThe multiplayer is truly horrendous, and honestly is not worth your time or money. Rockstar is being greedy as hell with these awful microtransactions. Please vote with your wallet and don't let this abomination happen again when Red Dead Redemption 2 comes to PC.",0.0

"EDIT: I installed Windows 7 Service Pack 1. After installation, I booted up GTA V again and it worked. This game is amazing. Steady 60 FPS, the graphics are way better than the Xbox One and PS4. This version is truly superior and it was totally worth the wait. 10/10 would kill hookers in first person againAttention to anyone having ""Social Club UI has stopped working"" issues, make sure you have Windows 7 SP1 installed and if not then install that and it should work for you.",1.0
"Since Rockstar resolved the issue with OpenIV I've removed the part about the single player mods being removed. The single player campaign is probably one of the only aspects I still like about the game, if you want to use the game for single player I strongly recommend it.  Multiplayer Though Rockstar recently brought back single player mod support to the game and more or less made peace with OpenIV my review still remains negative. Here's why Almost the entirety of recent multiplayer DLC is the same thing with new textures (CEO, MC, Bunkers and now Hangars which as much as they look interesting they in the end offer the same thing over and over again)My reason for saying this is because they all just feel like the same mini games with a small change in it where in a Company you may be carrying crates to a warehouse and in a Motorcycle Club you can carry counterfeit money to a ware house in a Bunker you can carry weapons to a warehouse, and with the newest DLC for multiplayer you can now smuggle goods in planes which is probably the only unique or interesting DLC since CEO's were added. All of these ""special collection of minigames"" for their prices (usually between 1-4mil in game dollars) Just feel the like the same repetitive game. The community is not regulated at all and hackers in public games are everywhere making the game unusable (people can still put an object on top of you repeatedly killing you, force you to blow up personal vehicles making you into a ""bad sport"" or just simply give you a bunch of money that gets you banned even if you didn't use or want the money. Usually there's someone in a jet trolling everyone else for no reason in public lobbies and nobody can do anything about it You can't do special missions for your CEO, MC or Bunker in a closed session making it nearly impossible to progress with them outside of the odd mini game they offer. There are so many needlessly overpriced items in the game which almost force you to buy shark cards (micro transactions) to get, for example $3,000,000 motorcycles or $5,000,000 special vehicles you can only get if you're a CEO or some other special member Everything about the online game has turned into a grind fest for money because you can't do anything without huge amounts of fundsEven though most people ask for a singleplayer DLC Rockstar doesn't make one and never will because singleplayer makes no money. GTA V is one of the top selling games in the last 10 years and Rockstar is still beating micro transactions out of this dead horse.UPDATE Honestly overall I'd only recommend this game for 90% off or better so then you have the extra money for the P2W which is this game.UPDATE I wanted to play single player but I'm forced to download content for multiplaye. Make it a separate download. GTA5 is my single biggest regret out of any purchase I've ever made",1.0

"It looks beautiful, but is really kind of a dreary game.  1) Crime is tedious.   I think there may be some value in this game being a good way to discourage young people from lives of crime because there is little reward, great risk and you have to associate with stupid, obnoxious people, performing senseless, unproductive and unprofitable activities like ""drive over here, pick up a truck, drive over here, kill those guys, get away from cops"".  Over and over.  2) The characters are tedious.3) The story is tedious. 4) The multiplayer is tedious.  You are forced to plan and execute ""heists"" with stupid obnoxious people, just like real life crime.Summary:  I'm  really suprised at how much I didn't like this game.  I'm a fan of the GTA series, and maybe it was the long wait, but I expected more.   The game makes for a great tech demo though.  It looks terrific.",1.0

"It's a very good game. You can run under the specs by tweaking the game files to get those few extra fps if you need them.Very great story, was interesting in my opinion.Also very good online play, quite interesting and addictive, would be great if there weren't all these cheaters out there.I would have lots of more hours if it wasn't released earlier for ps3, i am certain about that as i have spent lots of horus in there too.Well that was a review that was positive but is changed to negative because i want modding to be a part of the pc version, as it was for years on the gta franchise.Currently i don't recommend it and i would actually like a refund, features that were there suddenly disappearing is quite bad.And the negative will stay in here forever i guess. Rockstar keeps making bad moves in other more subtle ways. I remember hearing that they undermonetize the game yet even the more simple things have gotten way more expensive than they used to. You either need to grind for countless hours in online to get the things you want (remember there was a story mode at some point? rockstar does not).The game started off as a very great game but right now i would consider it a failure. I have stopped looking forward to gta 6 not because i know they just want to keep milking this game and screwing over the players but because i feel the same situation will be a reality when gta 6 launches.I totally regret buying it again (for the PC) and i would rather just play in the PS3 until support stopped for it (because apparently paying 70 euros for the game was not enough for them to let me play for more than 3 years)Farewell rockstar. -A very disappointed consumer",1.0

"(This is a GTA V Online review)GTA V Online is a fun game and you will have many hours of the game before it gets boring. One of the great things about the game is everything you can do! There are so many options. You can buy cars (huge range of cars), you can buy clothes (huge range of clothes) and you can become a ceo or a motorcycle club President. BUT there is a very bad thing, there is a lot of hacks to the game that rockstar isn't patching (A LOT). I have meet a lot of hackers who just kill you for 30 min or spawn planes to get everything laggy. Another bad thing is the waiting time. The waiting time is long when you enter GTA V Online. When you enter online you have to wait, when you enter a heist you have to wait, when your done with the heist you have to wait or if you quit the heist before it's done you have to wait. The waiting time with medium internet (it's longer to enter gta v online then joining a heist or leaving a finished heist) so i would have to say entering online would be minimum 10 minutes and leaving a finished (or unfinished) heist would be minimum 3-4 minutes.Rating: 7-10 - 8-10",0.0

I used to be the sort of person who bought every Rockstar game at launch. I somehwat enjoyed the singleplayer portion to GTA V (I completed it in roughly 60 hours and have never felt the need to go back) and I HATED the online portion. so much grinding with none of the roleplaying elements hinted at in the original trailers. What made me put almost 400 hours into this game however was mods. There was a great community making extraordinary mods for GTA V. I found the roleplaying elements I wanted. Features from previous games were restored! I was excited as hell and prepared to play this Rockstar Title to death. Now Take 2 and Rockstar say mods are a illegal infringement of thier publisher rights. If this isn't rectified I honestly cant see myself ever re-installing this game nor can I see myself purchasing future titles from this publisher. I simply relied on mods too much to enjoy this game in SP.,1.0

"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15. And shark cards can gobble my balls.",0.0
"The game itself is fantastic, no question. However the anti-cheat is false flagging legitimate players, removing millions in legitimate earnings – and Rockstar refuses to acknowledge it.I have lost trust in their ability to track their own in-game currency, therefore it is now worthless to me.Imagine a game where the saves randomly corrupted and reset hours of progress. I would immediately lose all interest in playing further, however good that game was.In the same way, I have no desire to continue playing GTA online until this is resolved. Legitimate progress can be arbitrarily wiped at any time, and “support” waves you off with a middle finger. Why bother.",1.0

"Its got great combat, a compelling story, and a very lackluster online. My big complaint for the online is the very big pay to win aspect.

I would enjoy online if it wouldnt take so long just to get into one like come on. Some of the matches wont even let you in if you dont have enough money/level so its basically useless. I suggest you just buy it for the single player thats a real treat!",1.0
"So in all seriousness, I played GTA V for 75 hours, and I don't really seem to enjoy it as much as I enjoyed Terraria. The game just feels... repetitive. There's not really much things to do in there, aside from killing cops, doing missions, playing with friends, etc. However, I only tend to play with my friends on Counter Strike: Global Offensive, instead of GTA V, which is a game supposed to encourage me to play the game with friends, where it can kinda give me the most out of the game. The storymode is kind of not-so engaging. I do love myself some stories in video games, but GTA V kind of has a relatively poor story. Also, I do have to mention that some of the game's updates make GTA V nearly unplayable, like the one update that made the game run from 60 FPS max to 30 FPS max, like it went from running pretty good, to being laggier than Payday 2. If anyone tries to hold a knife close to my throat so they can tell me that the game has some redeemable qualities, please understand. The game's not for me.",1.0

"As much as I would like to reccomend this game at this point I can't. The graphics are stunning, the SP story is deep and enjoyable, if anything it feels short. What makes this game anymore is the online portion. Nothing quite beats running around with a group of friends trying to accomplish sometimes seemingly impossible odds and overcoming, or just hooning around Los Santos with a set of supercars. However like so many others state the game is plagued by griefers, game crashers and other not so nice individuals. You can go private, however more than half the ways you would be able to make any money in this game are now neutered. R* wants to force you into risking everything against the others in the most insane PvP sessions there can be. For a game that has always been about the money it's become increasingly ridiculous. For a long while the T20 was king at $2 million, however that creep has jumped to $5 million for the new Ruiner 2000. You want to earn money? Sure there's heists, which haven't been updated in forever, you can sling drugs or counterfeit goods or move packages, all while being forced to run like hell and hope you don't have someone in your sessions just itching to ruin your chances. You want a house? How about the new office? How about the garage for that office? Keep paying out. $3M, 5M, 10M, the creep is unending. The game either makes you want to cheat and use mods to gain money or you best have the best damned heisting crews and go at it non stop to afford the lifestyle which the game always puts just out of your reach. Buy more cards, buy buy buy. That $100 card you bought to give you $8M? That could be spent on one car, and maybe a few mods if you aren't totally careful, or how about that yacht which does nothing but look at you off the coast. I really enjoyed the game, I did, but I can't reccomend this game to others right now while the amount of money or time you need to spend grows exponentially. If you have a lot of disposable income and wish to spend a few months salary playing catch up go for it, but you've been warned.",1.0

I can't even play this proply with my mates cause of the amount of cheaters there.I don't dislike mods, I love mods but when it's used in multiplayer, thats where it gets out of hand.Rockstar have done some shady stuff in the past as you can see with the other reviewers but I can understand them trying to ""dismiss"" the mods because a lot of people are using them in online but I can assume that's not the mod creators intentions and were for singleplayer use only.

"GTA V would have to be my favorite one in the series. It's clear that Grand Theft Auto is a series that satires American Culture. This game seems to satire American traditions a lot more than previous games, although it's very apparent, it doesn't over use the joke where it becomes predictable and boring. This game doesn't feel like a port at all and that's something that isn't really common with games that released on console first, it controls very well, and to state the obvious- the graphics are much better. (I originally played this on the 360, so I can't say anything about the Ps4 and the Xbox one) I could say there's a lot to do in the game, because there is, but I find after you do all of the missions and collect all of your shiny cars the single player is very dull. Replaying missions and spending my time robbing little stores and then getting my wanted level to the max to get a quick adrenaline rush, after the amazing campaign and the above average ""Strangers and Freaks"" missions the next best thing is the multiplayer where there is tons of stuff to do, free roaming becomes much more fun when you have a city full of other players waiting to shoot you in the head and screaming into the mic. If you're coming to GTA V from console then the multiplayer then might have left a very bad taste in your mouth, but they've added content, and removed a lot (not all) of the issues. 0/10",1.0

"Verdict: Absolutely recommended!Especially for a fan of the franchise.Rockstar have definitely done it again. Another great addition to the GTA franchise. Having played all PC released titles to date, and having a few hours of GTA V to my name, I will say, I am impressed. Sure, there were teething problems, and endless threads about performance issues, but they seem to appear with every new title these days; and eventually issues will be fixed and complaints go away.I'm glad to be back in San Andreas, the city and environment in general feels alive, the character switching provides for an interesting, and very different perspective; it is a little disorienting at first, but it makes perfect sense in the long run. The missions are varied, I love the fact that even your default vehicles now retain their Mods and re-spawn with them, and that it doesn't really take all too long until you get access to more advanced features. The special abilities each character possesses also add  lot to the game play, and I find myself doing what I've been doing since GTA III; randomly driving around doing absolutely nothing to further the story. And it is so much fun!The scale is also enormous. It does take a good 10 minutes of real time driving from Los Santos into the Vinewood hills (where the VINEWOOD/HOLLYWOOD sign is), and you can actually drive up there, right behind it and stand there and view the city. The sunset from that spot is almost as breathtaking as it would be in real life. Absolutely wonderful achievement in a video game, especially since I'm not even running the game on very high or even ultra settings. Which brings me to the next point in my review. Performance.As far as the playability is concerned, you will have to do some more or less extensive tweaking in the beginning. Definitely turn off the scanning for music on your computer, and try out what works best. I can play on normal to high settings with a Core2Quad Q9400 @ 2.66 GHz, GeForce GTX650 1GB and 8GB RAM (Windows 7 x64) and get smooth gameplay at 1600x900. I have population density at 50% and distance scaling at 30%. The game still looks better than GTA IV and probably on par with Watch_Dogs on high settings at 1080p that way. Good enough for me. I am going to add a GTX660 2GB soon (anything higher doesn't make any sense with my CPU), and I will see how much more I can push it. I can definitely recommend ""Razer Cortex"", and have it run optimizations and stop certain memory hungry services and processes while you're gaming. As an IT guy I'm usually doubtful of such software, but trust me, it works. Anything to squeeze a few more fps out of a game.So, in short: Even if you are at the bare minimum of required specs to run this game, I'd still get it. It will be playable, and as with all GTA titles, the fun hugely outweighs the graphical splendor; and you can make good compromises within the settings to make this work.Edit -- Aug 30th, 2015:I have now upgraded to a GeForce GTX660 2GB with my remaining specs staying the same. I can now play GTA V on High settings (except for textures, which I kept on normal), and on 1080p. Stable frame rates, and looks a lot better than before.You can say about Rockstar what you like, but compared to GTA IV's initial performance, they really did some good optimization here. It was worth the wait for the PC just for that.",1.0

"One of the best selling games that turned out to be the most utterly disappointed and outraged in the whole gaming community. Rockstar and Take-Two are only asking for money at this point, no more fun. Grand Theft Auto 5 however, at the time around release, was one of the best games ever to be released. I personally loved GTA 5 as a whole a while back, and I do have to admit GTA 5 has it's positives. It has been a lot of fun then and I will always remember the times I've had most fun with it myself and with friends. Now the game is being buried down further into the grave for me. After +1,200 hours it's really sad how it turned out. This game has turned out to be at the pit of♥♥♥♥♥♥for video games. I'm deciding to review it again.Pros: - Great storyline, Rockstar always makes a great story line - 3 characters to play as (Michael, Trevor, & Franklin) with neat special abilities - Graphics at the time were astounding and now is a lot more - Lively Environment, good diversity of activites to do, nature, people, and animals - Gameplay is straight-forward, easy to cling on to - Missions are great, side-missions are also pretty cool - Lots of cars, like LOTS of cars with detailed interiors and superb driving physics - Many weapon choices - Full Controller SupportCons: There's so many to list but I'll list the most common ones - No singleplayer DLC, nothing else to do in singleplayer  You have to use mods to get them - Online's extreme grindfest and absurdly priced items (some are pointless) - Broken & faulty anti-cheat, hackers are still ridden in public sessions and Rockstar is still banning innocent players - Rockstar's/Take-Two's pestering of notifications Online to buy things really tells that they want you to buy shark cards - Easy to spot laziness (Ex. about every car interior is the same, no difference) - Too many gamemodes milked out that almost no one plays now - Rockstar/Take-Two is adding a too much of cash-grab and/or unnecessary ""DLC"", not actually giving what players want (They are also adding things like Blimps way too late onto GTA Online) - Very long wait times - Disability to play CEO, Import/Export, Gunrunning, Hangar, and Warehouse missions in your own private session (which obviously means you have to play them on public, which makes it VERY very hardto complete any of either) - You are charged for literally owning a property, you never really hear a game doing this to you, thus making you have to eventually grind so you don't lose moneyPretty much all the downsides are belonging to Online mode. There is nothing really much wrong with Singleplayer, but it's like every GTA game. After you beat story mode there's not much to do, but then all ""DLC"" is moved to multiplayer. Now here's the problem, using mods to get something that's clearly unaccessible to singleplayer users then there's something wrong. Rockstar/Take-Two really tries to lure players to play GTA Online just so that they can have access to these things and yet, putting everything expensive and making it very hard for you to make millions and millions of GTA dollars (that is sadly mandatory). They are really trying hard to make you pay more for their game, that is horrendous to such a game. Yes, Valve does it but to me it's not horrendous and ridiculous like how GTA Online has it. Unfortunately there's nothing to end this pay-to-win or grind-to-win feature as many people have already payed for shark cards. In conclusion, GTA 5 is a bad game now. Singleplayer is good but you have to use mods or it just becomes dead for you. This game was nothing like this before. You'd want to beware or probably stay away buying this one. I do therefore recommend an alternative, check out FiveM. It's another Online realm where you won't have to worry about many things in difference to GTA Online.",1.0
"I love and hate this game at the same time. There are so many great things about this game, but there are lots of issues that can ruin it for everyone. With every online update, it costs more money to buy the new DLC content, making it so players have to grind for hours just to earn the money or buy shark cards (real money for in-game currency). Just having 1 million dollars used to be a lot in this game. Now most of the new cars cost more than that. Even when you buy the most expensive shark card (8 million in-game cash I think) that money is gonna be gone FAST. People get sick of grinding/buying shark cards and go to modding. Modders pollute online lobbies like crazy. It's impossible up to this point just to join a lobby without a modder dropping money, killing people, etc. The worst part of it is Rockstar hardly does anything about it. They give out bans and take modded money every once in a while, except they ban innocent people and take money out of legit accounts.Don't even get me started on the toxic community. Online isn't always like this, but if you play online you are bound to be in a situation like this.Single player is great! The graphics are stunning and it runs pretty good on medium/lower end systems. There is a lot of work put into designing this game and you can definitely tell. The story missions are great as well. Overall single player never gets boring especially if you have mods. A single player DLC would be awesome but Rockstar is too busy milking money from online players to do that. Oh well.I wish there was a neutral option for reviewing this game because it's a great game but it has a lot of issues.",1.0

"A great game that's been and keeps being ruined by bad decisions. This one was one of them. A big one to say the least.Take-Two is not only anymore a subsidiary to Rockstar Games. They have taken big control over the company as Rockstar Games keeps bringing other parties to compose the name of the company and letting them take control over it and their products. Take-Two is making some bad decisions over the actions they are taking against their games and their communities management. The poor and almost (if not) null feedback to the community and the over all mediocre management of the decisions to be made over the games, in this case, Grand Theft Auto V (not to mention the amount of micro-transactions and the subtle ""pay-to-win/pay-to-enjoy"" bases that the game now has over its dominant online interface) are really taking the experience and enjoyment of the game down the cliff thinking only with their wallets and not with their heads for what the customers deserve and want, leaving regular players, fans and long time followers of the Rockstar Games long history to just drop their forehead and eyes looking to the ground in sigh. Its one of the reasons I'm putting a vote for the OpenIV petition to bring it back.Take-Two needs to see that their feet are tapping over the line and its not something the community is going to tolerate anymore. OpenIV as well as many other projects that don't infringe with their policies are been attacked with legal threats, making it a direct hit to the fans. OpenIV was one important pillar for a very, very BIG amount of people to be dropped to the dust because of this threats from Take Two. Its really sad and just frustrating to see this type of things happen all the time over the gaming world, but one thing its just not caring about your customers opinions and another is to demolish their works, time and efforts to make their product feel more enjoyable, open and alive after fans getting no real support or reply on the communities desires and needs. They decided to take the jobs for themselves and make it real as the producers wouldn't. Rockstar Games and Take-Two need to see that the fans wont keep tolerating this type of actions over them anymore.

"Enforcing modding prohibition is bad for the health of your game, you should let your players express freely their creativity with the software they are purchasing.As for the game, it's a good game. I have played around 300 hs, most of them have been using singleplayer mods. Why? Because once you finish story mode, the singleplayer gets very boring, but you can add almost unlimited new content to enrich your singleplayer experience with mods.About online, let's better not talk about it. 35% of the time playing are just waiting for loading screens. Once you are in a session, you have a very laggy gameplay, only to be disconnected from your session with no apparent reason 10 minutes later. And this happens always to me.Want to pilot a cool plane? Or ride a nice car? Sure, just play 10 hours of missions you don't want to play in order to get the ingame money, OR, pay T2 for those ridiculous ""shark"" cards. This is why i needed mods in my game in order to make it enjoyable. If i want to pilot a plane, i want to pilot a plane, i don't want to play missions.",0.0

"First of all, I would like to state Rockstar Games has created something beautiful here. However I would also like to state that I used to be a huge fan of Rockstar games... Used to, not anymore. Rockstar Games has officially f**ked up with the PC release of GTA 5. Rockstar Social club (The retail copy version) is the single most useless & disfunctional game client ever made. Rockstar support is by far the most irresponsive support ever. Thank god we still have companies like Steam & Blizzard. For if PC gaming was to be left to Rockstar and Ubisoft which are increasingly becoming incompetent companies, PC gaming would be dead by now. Now assessing the game. GTA 5 is the best open world game released for PC since The Elder Scrolls V. It's vast openworld is only made better by increased interactivity with the environment around you. The fact that Rockstar Games payed great attention to every small detail makes this game amazing. The Single player story is very narrative and realistic. Although, I can't say the same things for the multipalyer since Rockstar still needs to work on their anti-cheat systems. Graphics wise, the game is so beautiful that you sometimes feel the need to just stop and enjoy the view. Rockstar Games has outdone themselves with GTA 5. However, due to Rockstar's newly acquired shady business practices, sh**ty support, sh**ty client and single handedly the worst retail copy in the history of mankind, my first experience with the PC version of this game was not pretty. But since this review is supposed to be about the game and not the developer company and since GTA 5 is still an awesome game and one of the best games I have ever played in my life, I recommend this game.",1.0

"It a damn shame to see Take-Two Interactive order a cease and desist to OpenIV for modding their games. The only reason why I still play the stupid campaign is because I have the oppertunity to mod it and make the experience much more fun for me every time I start it up. Since Rockstar is all about GTA V Online now they've stopped giving a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about singleplayer, so playing the same thing over and over with no change and no new content becomes really repetative. I, like many others, are very dissapointed in both Rockstar and Take-Two for getting rid of modding in their games, something that we all enjoy doing. I bought this game THREE times, once on the PS3, again on the PS4, and once more on the PC BECAUSE OF THE MODDING OPPERTUNITY. Thoughout this time mind you, no singleplayer DLC has ever come out. You expect us to play GTA Online, that is completly cancerous btw, buy Shark Cards and not mod your campaign because it lacks new content? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off.",1.0

"My favourite IP ever... destroyed by the developers and publishers who created it.Why would you destroy such a good and beneficial project as OpenIV that HELPS and BENEFITS your series?? All for 'Shark Cards'. So much greed.It wasn't 'Piracy', it wasn't anything but people purchasing your games to mod them for their own and others pleasure. You should be THANKFUL that people want to do this, you should be PROUD!Seriously, screw Take Two and Rockstar from now on. I've been a fan since GTA London, I own posters all across my gaming room of your (once was) fantastic IP's but not no more. You're just money grabbing greedy douches with zero care for your fanbase who bare in mind get paid NOTHING to mod, all for further promoting your games and making them more fun and enjoyable.Perhaps you should take a look at other developers and how they actively PROMOTE modding, as it is super beneficial to IP's in general.The real problem is R* and T2 not implementing a good anti-cheat, with all of their money and talent. So, let's instead take it out on the SINGLEPLAYER MODDING. OpenIV didn't even allow you online with mods activated!

" Singleplayer: 9/10  Multiplayer: 6/10 One of the most well-made games ever. The game revolves around 3 protagonists: Michael De Santa, a former bank robber who retired under Witness Protection, hoping for an ideal, quiet life, though things don't turn out that way; Franklin Clinton, a 2-bit hustler from the South aspiring more; and Trevor Phillips, an ex-Canadian Air Force pilot and Michael's former partner, who also happens to mentally unstable psyopath based in Sandy Shores, a small town in the desert not too far from the city limits. The three get tangled up in a series of crimes, bank heists, and wars in the city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.Pros: Large world map based on LA and the surrounding area Tons of customization for the 3 protagonists. Vehicles and weapons can be edited in in-game shops to have new features such a silencer on your pistol or bulletproof tires for your bike. Great gameplay, from shooting to driving, is well-done In 2018, it is still one of the most graphically impressive games ever made, even though the game came out in 2013. Very well optimized, because this game can run pretty well on just about any modern computer. Good story with very some very fun missions, especially the heists, the 'hood' missions, and Trevor's desert missions. Modding capability, which is a sweet bonus for PC players First-person mode!Neutral The online mode. While being potentially very fun, thanks to some of the community and Rockstar's microstransactions, the online mode has turned into a grindfest for all players who want to get anything, whether it be a property or sports car. Fortunately, with mods you are able to easily access the online content in the singleplayer, as well as the ability to play co-op with friends which almost makes up for it.Cons Loading is really long There are a lack of details in Los Santos compared to Liberty City. The most obvious is that LS has alot less interiors, while there are other, more subtle ways this is expressed, a big one being how LS feels 'fake' compared to LC, though you could argue this is intentional from the game developers. Online micro transaction ""shark cards"" are stupid. Everything in Online costs millions. Single-player DLC, like the ones for GTA IV and Red Dead Redemption never came out, though the single player is still good. There are some problems with the story, for example, Franklin is seen as boring and stale to many players, while Trevor has a deeply-divided fan base split between people who find him an interesting character and people who think he is an irredeemable psychopath. Verdict Definitely recommend for the single player, and since the game is now $30, there is barely any reason not to buy it and try it out, especially if it's on sale. I don't recommend the online mode, though, for the reason I listed above.",1.0
Highly optimized for low end PC's and has great gamplay and graphics. Does have a toxic community at times but what game does'nt now a days. And reccomend it for any one that has a group to play with unless you buy it for the singleplayer.,1.0
The only reason why I bought this game for the third time is for modding.

"So, after waiting for ages to sit down and do a proper review of GTA V, which I have acquired a decent amount of hours on, here's my rant.1. Optimization- I run this game on my ""High End"" gaming/workstation rig consisting of an i7 6800K, 64GB of RAM, and a 980ti Hybrid (Soon to be 1070). This game for the most part runs smooth, but its so damn glitchy. Having it installed on an SSD doesn't even improve load times in the slightest bit, I crash so damn often and I don't even know what's causing it half the time. When I do manage to load in, I get constant black screen loops and other glitches that lead to crashes and makes it a total hassle to even try to play the game due to having to wait nearly 10 minutes to load in after every crash. I love this game dearly, but for the love of PC Master Race, R* please optimize it.2. Recent Banwave.- A ton of players have been subjects to R* banwave. Some clearly deserve it and its great to see them being brought to justice, but in return, lots of innocent player's have been banned due to multiple flags being set off. One of my own friends got money dropped on him by an unknown hacker, then the hacker reported him, and he got banned within the next day. I've also read multiple reviews here regarding false bans and It's truly shocking to see how R* treats their players. Ban them, then provide no evidence or even try to work with them. I probably will update this whenever more rants come to me. TL;DRR* fix your game, and stop banning people who are innocent.",1.0

"Aside from the fact that GTA Online has been locked from many people for no reason as Rockstar's trashy DRM is in ""Offline Mode"", but now they've gone and taken away the biggest thing this terrible port had going for it.

OpenIV is the biggest tool to change things in the game, from adding new vehicles to changing how the player looks (An example being the famous Iron Man mod). Now that Take-Two has sent a cease and desist, they are basically saying it is illegal to mod their game.Do not buy this game.

Dont stare at this page and buy it already.Edit: Its no breaking news but my advice is u only start in closed friend / Crew sessions since the ppl who use scripts to either kill people, mess up their game or spawning money and cars increased. It was ok arround christmas but open sessions are barely playable. You also want to restart your online session if you found yourself in a session with a scripter as they can bug your weapons.This means do restart the whole game, not simply log into a new session as not visible bugs still can be there.If you do the 10-12 000 000 Mastermind challange this is especially highly recommended.

"1)  Rockstar has betrayed its fans and declared that modding their software is in violations of its terms and conditions.  The popular modding suite from OpenIV that tens of thousands of GTA players use to run fun mods like LSPDFR, has received a cease and desist letter from Take Two Interactive's legal team.  Take Two is the parent company of Rockstar.  2)  Rockstar has made it mandatory to connect to Rockstar's social club in order to play any aspect of GTA, including single player.  Thus, any use of ""illegal"" mods or cheats can result in a ban from using Rockstar's online service, thus, you will no longer be able to play GTAV, even though you paid for it.  Rockstar has taken the stance that you no longer own a copy of the software, rather, license the privilege to use its software on the condition that you adhere to every single one of Rockstar's ever changing terms.3)  It isn't lost on my that Rockstar has been fighting a seemingly losing battle to stop cheaters in the online game, many of whom are using mods that use OpenIV's plugin.  However, TakeTwo Interactive has also gone after another modding community that was creating a private server mod for GTAV that would enable people to play GTAV on private servers with mods and not ruin the GTA Online experience for other players.  Instead of meeting the consumer half way and either securing GTA Online better, or supporting private LAN or private servers like most games do, TakeTwo and Rockstar once again show that they are only concerned with corporate profits, and do not wish the players to play GTAV in any other mode or setting unless Take Two can have complete control and profit from it.I will no longer be supporting a mindless corporate machine that wishes to seek legal action against its consumer base for modifying the product to suit one's own needs.  I am effectively boycotting Take Two Interactive and Rockstar.",1.0

"GTA 5 (Singleplayer) is a great game, everythin you'd want from a GTA game and more. I enjoyed it on Xbox, and I enjoy the improved PC version just as much. But the reason for my review is offcourse, GTA: Online.Absolute utter garbage. There is zero incentive by R* to create a decent community, it's basically everything bad that happened to gaming in one. There is gacha elements, constant ""advertising"" by NPCs to make you buy that car / facility / factory, facebook-esque gaming vibe.You are constantly remininded of the fact that OTHER PLAYERS are there -supposedly- to ♥♥♥♥ you up. As such, nobody trusts anybody. You could just be minding your own business and all of a sudden you're dead because that other guy thought you we're going to kill him. So you start having to kill every player in sight to get anything done. Or just run and get nothing done. There is no dedicated servers, meaning your loading times can last for up to 20 minutes if you're unlucky.The game is riddled with people who do nothing more than hunt down new players in their Attack Helicopters, or kill you AFTER you group with them only to steal the money you just earned TOGETHER.Crews are meaningless, they're just 4 lettres next to your name. Other than a handful of extra cash / reputation you gain absolutely nothing from being in a crew. Motorcycle Clubs or Corporations are just as bad. You can't sit in both at the same time, forcing you to go through the creation process EVERY TIME you relog, get a new session... If you are running said Club / Corp  you'll have to leave it if you want to help your friends with their Club / Corp. Having to juggle something as simple as, what is in essence a ""clan"" is horrible.Now, I could deal with most of these things, but what I find absolutely appaling is the artificial difficulty they put upon GTA:Online (compared to GTA:SP), everything is outrageously expensive compared to the amount of money you can make. I received one free shark card with my purchase of GTA:O, worth 1.25M in-game, and without it I am certain I would've had to grind 20-30 hours in order to buy an appartment / some weaponry / a personal vehicle. (All of them cheap!) Because of the card I got somewhat of a headstart but it just made it so much more apparent I would have to, again, grind hours and hours in order to be albe to do a Heist with my friend. Or to expand my Motorclub to be actually usefull. Another big no-no is the amount of content / DLC added to GTA:O that was PURPOSEFULLY omitted from the single-player version. There is 100s of vehicles and dozens of weapons / locations that are not accessible in single-player. Why? THey need you to play GTA:O, start hating it and eventually cave in to shark cards.That is the gamingloop GTA:O banks on, grind your♥♥♥♥♥♥ buy the thing, discover you need to use the thing to grind even more♥♥♥♥♥♥ Repeat ad infinitum. No wonder the game is rampant with hackers and cheaters. I met someone who got 200M from a hacker, that guy is now enjoying the game as he can buy (maybe 25% of) all things and just play y'know. But to get anywhere near his level I'm looking at atleast 150h investment. This would be no problem if the game was atleast fun, but it's not.GTA:Singleplayer outshines GTA:O in every single way possible. The only reason I'd ever recommend this game is if you'd play it with a closed group. Get atleast 3 more people and do nothing with randoms, only play with your 3 other friends. Maybe, just maybe, the game would be enjoyable. But trying to do things with just 1 real partner is impossible.All in all, I'd say I regret my descision of buying this game and it saddens me that GTA:O absolutely shrekt Rockstars reputation for me. I've been a loyal fan / buyer since their very first game, but the fact that they'd allow this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥to bear their name, and clearly have no issue with it, is the final red flag. I will NOT be buying GTA 6 or RDR2 for that matter.AVOID THIS GAME! SPEND YOUR MONEY ON SOMETHING FUN INSTEAD!",1.0

In addition to this the whole system is designed to entice you into purchasing various ""cash cards"" since it will take hours of your time to buy any of the better items.It is legitimately difficult to find a public lobby where someone isn't spawning random high-tier vehicles, money, or using various griefing cheats.

They want you to buy sharkcards which would cost you $127.76 (60% discount for summer sale) or normal price of $319.96. This is absolutly outrageous.

"""At 25, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because your game gave me cancer anyway.""Thanks Rockstar....Decent game, 8/10 for nostalgia and first person single player offline boring as watching paint dry mode.While also retaining a rating of: Pile of garbage that devs obviously don't care about anymore.One could preface this game by saying, ""In a world.... where every 10 year old has ♥♥♥♥ed your mom...."" or, ""In a world, where even your ""safe house"" is just a giant target for griefing..."" or, ""In a world, where no one regulates or takes steps to prevent cheating...""""In a world, were multi-billion dollar long awaited U.S. titles are inferior to free online Chinese MOBA's due to constant updates, cheater invulnerability, and effective ways in reducing player toxicity.""If I never played GTA V online I wouldn't have a problem, however when a company boasts their online capabilities and uses it as it's main attraction for their product, would it be sensible to put the time and effort into their work to ensure a seamless experience? Apparently not.... Rockstar has finally landed themselves in my major ESAD line among companies like EA, 2K(also a Take-Two subsidiary), Ubisoft, Activision|Blizzard(Treyarch), and Konami.... Once supreme game dev companies who over the past decade have shown an increasing unwillingness to acknowledge their gamers wishes. Which is strange considering if there are no gamers to support your games, there are no game sales. After a while, regardless of what you build, I'd rather come in a sock than give Rockstar the satisfaction of bending me over again.EDIT: Two years later and nothing has really changed. More heists, more purchases, more griefing, more hackers, more glitches, and now more failures to save to the cloud services. I still play, but only when capable of playing with 3 or more people so we can gang up on anyone griefing. Hackers make it hard to stay in one lobby for too long though.... still....",0.0
One of the most immersive sand-box multiplayer games of all time.Pros:- Excellent multiplayer coop capability- Huge expansive world with lots to do- Tremendous amount of customization- Heists are the most amazing thing to ever be added to this game- Great graphics and soundCons:- Awful single player storyline (hood ganster style ghetto BS)- No new Heists :(- Microtransactions for real life money (Shark Cards)- Lots and Lots of hackers in multiplayerOverall a lot of fun and worth getting!,1.0

"Don't let my low amount of hours fool you, this game is worth every penny.  I played the sh*t out of this on PS3 and then on XBOX 1, and I'm very glad I purchased it for PC.  The more accurate shots, the easier it is to talk to people, and the amount of cash you can receive is better.  The helicopter and plane controls are super funky, if you don't have a spare controller lying around you may want to know that you need to use your numpad to fly.  Other than vehicle controls being wank I enjoy this game very much and would recommend it to a friend.",1.0
"Online Shark Cards have ruined this series. No longer do we see amazing story driven DLC that was actually worth the price of admission.  Instead we get piecemeal dlc that amounts to a new toy you get to play with for about an hour before being bored with it and throwing it away with the rest of the toys.  Now that doesn't sound too bad if it weren't for the hours of grinding required (or buying a real money Shark Card!). They've also just recently as of this review, done their best to remove a large part of the single player modding capability by sending legal (unwarranted) threats to the modders themselves. It's another case of a big rich bully knowing they can't win in a court of law but doing it anyway knowing that there is no benefit for the modder to fight and lose money/time in the process. Don't support these cash grab companies that have fallen so far from the pedestal they once stood upon. Shame on you Take Two. Choke on your money.",1.0

It makes the experience feel like a lame gamified iOS game.from another review that expressed exactlye what i want to say -The lastest exampleToday Rockstar Games, and their publisher TakeTwo Interactive sent a cease and desist to the developers of OpenIV, a tool made for modding GTA and allowing the games to thrive years after release. So much time and effort put into the tool so that people could make the game their own and it's all gone due to the greed of Rockstar and TakeTwo. I will never buy another Rockstar game after this and it was bad enough as it was with them turning onlline play from something basic and fun in GTA IV into a greed propeled grindfest.",1.0

"You buy a game about criminals, stealing, killing, and corruption. You play online and blow up someone's car? They have a system in place to label you and make you out to being a ""bad sport"", and if you go far enough that's the only people you can play with in lobbies.Rockstar's logic right there folks.Edit: You also get a bad sport rating if you leave jobs in-game especially when you get matched up with team mates on heists missions where your team mates have an IQ lower than the bullet count  in the cylinder of a revolver.Newer edit: Rockstar: HERE'S A BUNCH OF NEW CONTENT!

"EDIT: Take-Two backed off, but the game still fails in multiplayer.TL;DR: Take-Two is ♥♥♥♥ing us all with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer and they're trying to kill the modding community for eternity.Grand Theft Auto V is one of my favorite games of all time.But I cannot recommend it as it is today.I started playing GTAV almost at release on console, and when it came to PC, I was so incredibly excited. I remmebered the multiplayer and modding potential of GTA4 PC, and I wanted to have that again. GTAV did not deliver.In respect to multiplayer, it is a grindy hell where you have to worry about the cost of ammo and guns, and mission payouts are so low you have to grind for hours to get anything decent. Thats if you get people who are willing to play for you. Multiplayer now is a microtransaction hell where you can either spend months to get $3,000,000 (which I did), or pay real money for ingame dollars, up to $100 real dollars. But hey if you don't have that, there are plenty of ways to make around $5,000 at a time. Really the only good way to make big bucks is the heists, and there are so few of them, and the payout is split. In addition, no one ♥♥♥♥ing plays them anymore. I have sat in queues for up to 10 minutes trying to find a heist. So unless you have 3 friends with several hours free, you aren't making enough money for... anything.Now on to the modding. During E3 this year (2017), Take-Two sent a ceast-and-desist letter to the modders that make OpenIV, the framework for most other mods. In doing so, Take-Two is essentially attempting to stop modding of GTAV (THIS IS NO LONGER THE CASE). Now many may be thinking, ""Well modding sometimes allows hackers/cheaters to exploit the game"" and while this is true, people are modding the game either for fun, like dumb guns that explode planets, or for necessity. But why is it necessary to mod? Well in GTAV, there have been many free DLC updates that have expanded the game immensly. But only online. The years of free updates have never been added to the single player. All because Take-Two wants more people in online, because that's where the money is made. People have modded single player, ONLY single player, to access these mods, but now if modding goes down, people will be forced to play a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ multiplayer for hours, days, even weeks to access new content. Modding needs to stay. Only a select few hackers hurt the game, while the majority only want to have fun with mods. Or access DLC that should already be in the single player.It's a shame, really. GTAV has one of the best story modes of any game I have ever played, as well as some of the best mechanics, graphics, characters, etc. While I love GTAV and will probably continue to play it, I cannot recommend it to anyone looking for a good multiplayer or modding experience.",1.0
"The game is a masterpiece in gamedesign, music and gameplay. It has a big open world, ALOT of cool viehicles to drive, and a cool story. the online is also pretty cool (alltho i didnt play alot), theres coop missions, races and heists witch give you money, and XP upon succeseding.

"I will grade the multiplayer aspect of this game and say.Yes it is fun with friends but its very much a ""PAY TO WIN"".You can litterally pay money into the game and buy better cars and weapons. It really is no wonder why there is a community of people who hack money and cars in.Obtaining anything in multiplayer is already a grind in its own. Although I must say that I enjoy most if not all the missions you can get with your friends. The problem stands that there really isnt enough of them to do that won't get repetative.This game is although a great sandbox game where you can go around with your friend for a drive in a really nice car and do whatever. Wanna ride a car off a mountain? Go ahead. Ill see you in the hospital after you die. Then we'll do it again, except this time off a bigger mountain.All in all. I still can not recommend this game because of the sandbox aspect of it. There are people who hack because there are people who pay to win and because of this some people feel like there really can't pay so they must hack. It's a circle of problems with that. Sure they can get banned but given how large the community is. No one should have to decide on wether or not they should pay to win or hack to win. This doesn't show people good morals. It's what makes most people hate gaming developers and even though this is Rockstar(a gaming company that is apart of my childhood). I must say I am not at all enjoying what this is doing to the video game industry.",1.0

Haven't talked to him in ~6 or 7 months. Says he's going to buy GTA V. He does it, installs it. My Good buddy, My Friend and I boot up GTA Online. My friend is permanently banned from GTA Online.***************************************************************Nobody likes cheaters, the guy who drives around and shoots everyone with his explosive pistol. Those guys need to be banned. What about the guy who spawns money on himself and others? Well, there's no doubt he's ""Impeding Shark-Card sales"", so ban him. What about the guy who got money dropped on him? Lucky you, rockstar already answered this question, they said they wouldn't.However, it's speculated that you can get banned for selling cars that you buy with money that gets dropped on you. It's also speculated that using some of these programs will get you banned.http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=699189421Notice how all the ban reasons are speculated. This is because rockstar doesn't tell people why they get banned. Having 800 hours on a game and not logging in after a major update out of fear of being permanently banned is stupid. But it's what people have to do. That or get banned and have to go spend 60 dollars on another copy of gta v______________________________________TL:DRTo conclude, random bans happen and rockstar won't explain them. Only buy for single player. The random ban is constantly floating over your head. Rockstar support sucks.{Sorry if the end of the review is♥♥♥♥♥♥ I think I ran out of characters, so I made cuts}",1.0

"All I can say is.. oof. I can tell you that for a game it is very great, I played a majority of this game on the PS4 and I do love it overall but for this, it is a steam review. And I have to rate this based off a game on its console.For starters I'll go over story mode; I love it to death and played it over multiple times.. I personally wish Rockstar made on their promise before their GTA Online release months later after the games release, that they would add a bit of story mode DLC to their game, I would have absolutely LOVED to buy their DLC. I can understand how hard it may be to implement into a game like this but RDR (and I understand this is a different game on its own) has its own DLC with it and it was a captivating DLC. But story mode, a nice 8.5/10.. I respect it with all the realism on the story mode.Now for the online portion, and we have a problem.. I'll go over everything and won't miss a detail.Missions - Straightforward.. it is a bit fun but it can be repetitive with spamming them to get cash at lower levels and hell, it is fun for those who start off.Adversary Mode - I can't exactly understand as to why this is even a mode to start out with.Hobbies (golf, darts, etc.) - The only real 'mission' I can consider even putting myself under for online. Golfing is fun, darts is a bit on the meh side but.. it is a blast.Heists - I really love the idea and have awaited months/years for this release, all of us have. I also find it very, very fun. I'm a bit bummed that we can't have a free play heist mode where we can go over to the bank it rob it on our own, because with this we can actually set up and find ways to escape wihout objectives to tell us what to do but it is still fun. BUT I really hate the fact that it isn't very rewarding to those who look into needing money unless you have done the ever-challenging Mastermind Challenge or first time bonuses. I can understand if Rockstar wants to keep this game alive by giving people something to keep playing on but, it needs to be a bit more rewarding. At least, at least.. Add stock markets to online.In-game pricing - EVERYTHING and I mean EVERYTHING on this game has a high price, nothing is cheap on this game. The only way you are ever going to ever afford something as expensive as a Hydra you may have unlocked from a heist. Or a yacht, or a house, a garage, a nice car, nice outfits.. anything. You NEED to be able to pick up every last bit of your life savings and save up to even something you are really, really wanting. Again, I get that you need people to stick around so this game doesn't die. But you guys have already claimed billions from people because of this game, and hell we can make that kind of money on singleplayer but please knock down your prices, the singleplayer mode is a reasonable price for everything. ALL GTA Online clothing items and some cars are reasonable. If prices won't go down for some of these things, please fix your payout for missions/heists.. everything.. or just add a stock market. You have billions, it's possible to implement. If monkeys can be turned into humans, then we can have common sense to add a market.Companies - Okay, I get this is the new age of money making it is possibly even shatters heisting which makes everything else not even worth it but let me tell you, it is a hell of a grind unless you have friends. Doing things alone you will be frustrated because other people will blow you up or even kill you and steal from you. Investing in your business overall, if you have friends, will possibly make you a millionaire over time but don't count your lucky stars, you won't become rich that easily or that fast.Controls - This is just an opinion so don't attack me just because I have my own matter of opinion, if you just have a PC and are only playing on a PC. My advice, change all the controls you are comfortable with. I can't bother scratching my head to what button goes where on my keyboard (this makes PS4/Xbox a hell of a lot better), but Oblivion.. you could just use a controller. No.. Coordination with the controller is bad it doesn't even match up with my game, let alone work.. I tried hours on end to affixiate my controls and everything but I can't be asked anymore with the controls.P2P - GOD, please.. remove the shark cards from stores because they aren't worth what you pay for. You will make more money just doing missions alone.. DO NOT buy cards and buy in to their market.Free-world gameplay - The core of this game is your time in a server (now extended to 28 to 32 than the original 16) and playing with others or on your own.. I don't get why you would play by yourself, I guess to save yourself from the toxic community this game has to offer, whether it is you to git gud or get rich. The survivability on this game is insane, I tell you if your a low level player, everyone will make attempt to want to kill you as your the most vulnerable person on that server. I'm not complaining as I'm level 200 but for a steam review, a steam game, playing a PC version and having to play a online game starting over.. boy it is hard to make a living within an online server without getting killed within 10 minutes. Bounties alone will make you an easy target. It does not matter who you are by the way, even if you might be in a random crew they will all make attempt to want to kill you, everyone hates you unless you meet another low level or if your lucky you might run into a nice level 125 or something and help you. A very racist, sexist, and discriminating community.. for the exceptional others.. the nice players.. I love you. But for those who mudstompped me and spawn killed, you are as toxic as toxic gas, my friend.. I can't stress enough to be pulled up on by a tank when I'm just driving by minding my own business, riding my bike and just getting blown to bits. Aside from that, and countless times being killed by Hydra/Laser swarmer try-hards.. Cheaters are a majority of the problem. I get I was involved within a modded server but hell can't I play a legit game? Yeah it may be nice getting millions to billions of dollars just to be able to buy things, and getting your rank modified.. but I hate it to those who think they are God on a server and can 'help those in need'.. a little sympathy for Rockstar not being able to put a full stop to these cheaters, it isn't just modding alone, the glitching section of the community too. I remember back in the day with the Adder selling glitch being a top priority to make money, I'm guilty to buying into it, yes.. but the game is no fun when you have cheaters too ruining your fun. But hey, we are all different doing our own things so.. you do you.But Rockstar, a message from a newly steam reviewer to the big shot in the offices over at your studio.. FIX your community, FIX your game, FIX the prices, FIX the rewards, other than that you are standing on a literal gold mine, you have a semi-perfect game. The stunts are amazing, I like stunts.. I like dressing up.. I like all the little bits and pieces and all you have to offer but at this stage it makes it harder for new players to just rise back to glory with the community and pushing people to buy something that is.. not.. worth.. it. $100 for $8 million? Damn, I'm better off buying a new games collectors edition and completing it without P2W. so.. please fix it.. please. I've been with this game since its release so, I hope either A we do something about this in the future where we can have a great game, or B.. lose people and the community drops like GTA IV did.Okay.. after an hour of this review.. I think it deserves a rating.Singleplayer - 9/10Steam Multiplayer - 1/10Console Multiplayer - 4/10Fix your game.",1.0

"Rockstar(the developers of this game) are a bunch of sheckel grabbing, power hungry, big-corporation scammers that only exist to make money off of you AFTER you've paid FULL PRICE FOR THIS AAA GAME through MICROTRANSACTIONS!Boo! We want mods! Mods made GTA great!

All the things you can do in this game is phnomenal that goes with the Online Mode but bigger.

I literally got nuked everytime I respawned so me and other online players all banned the same guy at the same time. This game is a must have if you want the story. Even though the content in online mode is constantly expanding there is still not enough quality unlike the early days of gta 5. Buy Gta5 for the story mode but if you are buying for the Online Mode do it at your own risk.Peace...",1.0

"My only purpose for buying this game a few years back was to mod the single player version. Why? Because I have a PC. I have been modding and playing games for years on the PC for this very reason. I do like multiplayer games, don't get me wrong, but a single player game I can mod the hell out of brings enjoyment for years to come. It also makes me want to continue to buy titles from game devs that support modding the PC versions of their games. Take Two just insured I will be looking for any title they create, so I can avoid it. I may not be able to offer the poor OpenIV team any help in taking on these massive tools at Take Two, but lord knows the makers and folks who sell anything PC related should rain down money on them to help. Why? I spend thousands every few years on PC parts and gadgets to play games, games I can enjoy, games I can mod. Do you want us all to become console players? I think that would kill a lot of companies. So I give GTA V a thumbs down, since now, it is not worth the money I paid.",0.0

"4.5 / 5Horrendous DRM and business practices by R* aside, this game is one of the most expansive, immersive, and detailed games I've ever owned. The single-player story is rich with character development, and provides an enjoyable, suitable-length story. The graphics are decent all-around, however, mouth movement during dialogue looks a bit awkward. It's a great port, and runs fairly well, provided you have a half-decent system.I only wish R* would lower the price, since not many PC gamers are ever going to buy it at the full $60.",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games ever made.",1.0

"Let me start from the statement that this is the great game and I spend and still spending a lot of time in it with pleasure, creating interesting challenges with friends. You can do countless things and this game replaces literally tons of other games like racing games, shooters, simulators and stuff. But I have to rate it thumbs down as I'm tired from R* politics no, not about Open IV, - about ingame economy! It's disaster!I know that to be high on steam ratings people should play the game more but they shouldn't grind all day to buy 1 car! I'm playing GTA Online from the 1st day of the PC lunch and love all the modes and heists but after lowriders prices on cars and property got higher and higher. Yes, you can say developers want to sell shark cards for the reason all DLCs are free but ok then - I bought the game for the price of Megalodon card (8 000 000 gta $) and lets look what we can buy on this - 4 cars? For the price of card that costs the price of the game I should be able to buy ALL the property in the game 10 times. All DLCs that came out already required less time and money to develop then original game for shure and why should I pay the price of the AAA game for opportunity to buy 5 cars??? Now we came to conclusion that there is two ways out of this situation:1. I'll do as R* want me to do - will grind all day stealing cars and selling it. Do you think it's fun R*??? Seriously? And there is like no more then 10 scenarios of that missions! I will be able to drive blind from any of those spots to my wharehouse. So for example I shoud do this sh///t with cars for 2 days just to buy 1 car for 1.5 mil. This is no fun. This kills fun and gets me angry. Gta wasn't the grind game in the past - but now it's close. 2. Second way out - order a character upgrade from some modder or bacome a cheater. Many people do that just because they don't what their favorite game to become grind simulator where you can even play with friends because they need money to and they have to be the boss as you are. So people order upgrade and get 500 000 000 gta $ for 10 real USA $ and can get anything the game can offer. And they keep fun alive and play happily! So if R* wants to keep their fans happy with GTA online they have to make prices 10 times lower fo everything or to sell shark cards with the amount of cash that allows to buy anything in game. Because now it's just unrespectful for people who wants to play fair. We are the only ones who looks like fools now. Grind money all day without actually playing the game and then walking to the person who have everything cheating. C'mon! You can't even choose the right paint color for chrome paint without paying 10 times for different combinations you don't like. You call it fair R*??? Show some respect for you real fans.",1.0

"All in all, I can't recommend GTA V. The bad outweighs the good, and a lot of the time I felt frustrated by the design and limitations. Ok price would be 15 euros, no more.The bad:Bad NPC AI: The civilians suffer from bouts of psychotic rage for no reason, and the cops are teleporting telepaths occasionally equipped with X-ray vision. Commonly an NPC attacks you for standing near them, you beat him in fist-fight, and 8 cars worth of cops storm your location like you have an excess of free baseball tickets to their favourite match. When they arrive, they'll start shooting like you were Hitler reborn. Drive away, and soon there'll be a full-on manhunt with sniper-helicopters.Badly optimized: With GTX 970 and compared to e.g. Mad Max, the game looks nowhere near as good, yet constantly stutters in FPS, has shadow-glitches and uses VRAM like a manic graphics designer. Occasionally FPS also drops to the single-digits, at which point quit & restart is the only option. Getting to the main menu and loading the game lasts about as long as the last ice age. Buildings are props: You can't enter most of the buildings. Many of them are stores, but nothing can be bought from them.Disappearing vehicles: Each of the main characters has a signature vehicle, which is pre-chosen for you, and will basically be the only vehicle you can consistently modify and find at your home. Other vehicles can be stolen, but good luck in them not despawning if they get out of your FOV. Often they despawn if you so much as get out of the vehicle to fart. When they do, all of the customizations you put in and paid for, are gone. Sometimes, you can find them at a ""rebound"" place, but it's not near your homes and getting there every single time is a chore. You can buy garages, which hold a maximum of 4 cars, but if the vehicle despawns it won't be found in the garage either. Inconsistent: All the main characters supposedly kill without remorse, and 2/3 have anger and revenge -issues. Yet they just accept it when they get treated like servants and pushovers over and over again.Limited: When you get that money, you won't be using it that much. There are no new houses to build, you can't build new appliances for your existing ones or decorate them in any way. No upgrading your HiFi -sets, no new TVs, nothing. City properties are not for sale, except at some pre-chosen places. For example, only one car-customization place can be bought, and you won't be using it much as it's in the middle of nowhere. There's a fairly big selection of guns, which however are pretty similar in action. E.g. I've now unlocked three assault rifles, in which the only difference is some stats and sound. Specialized bullets are not available and cannot be bought. Very few haircuts / beards are available. Cars, also, you can buy - but why the hell would you buy cars in Grand _Theft_ Auto? Then there's also tattoos, which pretty much look the same, and some ordinary clothes. Car-customization is really the only fun thing to put money to, and even there you'll be wondering why you can't customize things such as benches. In addition, many vehicles - such as ambulances or tanks - cannot be customized at all, so you won't be driving that pink camo tank around. You also can't install turrets, rams, or anything like that to the vehicles.Money via the stock market: Basically, the only way to really make money in the game, is the stock market. And this involves load-save -scumming hundreds of times to set the prices. 95% of the missions have no reward at all.Obnoxious random encounters: On the way to main missions, you encounter things such as purse-robberies and people asking for chaffeurs. These cannot be turned off, and can have problems respawning if you don't do them right then. It's like back in Skyrim, when all you want is to get to the town to sell some furs, and an army of priests and talking dogs forces their way to you, needing help _now_.Realistic grimdark tamagochi design decisions: All character stats drop with time, if they're not used. Be ready to upkeep 3 triathlonista-tennisplayers, who like to drive against the traffic, frequent the shooting range and sneak around the neighbourhood. Body armour is single-use, so you can buy it over and over again.Self-conflicting design: 95% of the missions offer no reward whatsoever, even though the principal motive of the main characters is supposedly to get money. You'll be asking yourself, why am I doing these things for these people? With many missions, the characters have such diabolus-ex-machina -style bad luck, that it seems the designers are trolling you. Combined with the characters just accepting it, even though they are supposedly hardened psychotic money-hungry criminal tough-guys, it really leads to problems with suspension of disbelief.Sexist: No female main characters, three male main characters.Unimaginative: The tattoos you can buy are all very unimaginative, with the only tongue-in-cheek one being a single small smiley face. No coloured tattoos. Clothing selection is equally unimaginative, only ordinary clothes are available. You won't be buying any outrageous leather skinsuits here. You can buy eyeglasses, but they all look hipsteresque and there are no dark sunglasses. For vehicles, no textured paintjobs - such as Hello Kitty -liveries - are available.The good:The character of Trevor made me laugh. He was also the only really empowering main character in the whole game. Of the other main characters, Michael likes to wallow in constant self-pity, and Franklin is basically a greedy jerk who keeps belittling and berating his friends, while never arranging any work himself, and never does anything for his aunt who has given him a place to live. Car chases can feel intense.Customizing cars is fun.I had fun with some of the main missions.Some of the critical humor, such as with Fabien the yogi and Michael's son Jimmy, is pretty funny.You can fix some of the problems, such as disappearing cars, via modding.

He insisted on teleporting me in the middle of the ocean over and over again. By the time I was able to swim to land, I would be dead. Hackers ruin GTA.I finally met a nice hacker that gave me some cash bags. I bought myself a Zentorno and maxed it out.

"Source : IGNFor me, Grand Theft Auto V’s extraordinary scope is summed up in two favourite moments. One is from a mid-game mission in which I flew a plane into another plane, fought the crew, hijacked the thing, and then parachuted out and watched it crash into the sea to escape death at the hands of incoming military fighter jets. Another time, whilst driving around in an off-road buggy, I got distracted by something that looked like a path up one of the San Andreas mountains. Turns out it was a path, and I spent 15 minutes following to the summit, where I nearly ran over a group of hikers. “Typical!” one of them yelled at me, as if he nearly gets run over by a rogue ATV on top of a mountain every time he goes on a hike.I could go on like this for ages. GTA V has an abundance of such moments, big and small, that make San Andreas – the city of Los Santos and its surrounding areas – feel like a living world where anything can happen. It both gives you tremendous freedom to explore an astonishingly well-realised world and tells a story that’s gripping, thrilling, and darkly comic. It is a leap forward in narrative sophistication for the series, and there’s no mechanical element of the gameplay that hasn’t been improved over Grand Theft Auto IV. It’s immediately noticeable that the cover system is more reliable and the auto-aim less touchy. The cars handle less like their tires are made of butter and stick better to the road, though their exaggerated handling still leaves plenty of room for spectacular wipeouts. And at long last, Rockstar has finally slain one of its most persistent demons, mission checkpointing, ensuring that you never have to do a long, tedious drive six times when you repeatedly fail a mission ever again. Grand Theft Auto V is also an intelligent, wickedly comic, and bitingly relevant commentary on contemporary, post-economic crisis America. Everything about it drips satire: it rips into the Millennial generation, celebrities, the far right, the far left, the middle class, the media... Nothing is safe from Rockstar’s sharp tongue, including modern video games. One prominent supporting character spends most of his time in his room shouting sexual threats at people on a headset whilst playing a first-person shooter called Righteous Slaughter (“Rated PG – pretty much the same as the last game.”) It’s not exactly subtle – he literally has the word “Entitled” tattooed on his neck, and the in-game radio and TV’s outright♥♥♥♥♥♥takes don’t leave much to the imagination – but it is often extremely funny, and sometimes provocative with it. Grand Theft Auto’s San Andreas is a fantasy, but the things it satirises – greed, corruption, hypocrisy, the abuse of power – are all very real. If GTA IV was a targeted assassination of the American dream, GTA V takes aim at the modern American reality. The attention to detail that goes into making its world feel alive and believable is also what makes its satire so biting.Grand Theft Auto V’s plot happily operates at the boundaries of plausibility, sending you out to ride dirt bikes along the top of trains, hijack military aircraft, and engage in absurd shootouts with scores of policemen, but its three main characters are what keep it relatable even at its most extreme. The well-written and acted interplay between them provides the biggest laughs and most affecting moments, and the way that their relationships with one another developed and my opinion of them changed throughout the story gave the narrative its power. They feel like people – albeit extraordinarily f***ed-up people.Michael is a retired con man in his 40s, filling out around the middle as he drinks beside the pool in his Vinewood mansion with a layabout son, air-headed daughter, serially unfaithful wife, and very expensive therapist – all of whom hate him. Franklin is a young man from downtown Los Santos who laments the gang-banger stereotype even as he’s reluctantly seduced by the prospect of a bigger score. And then there’s Trevor, a volatile career criminal who lives in the desert selling drugs and murdering rednecks; a psychopath whose bloodthirsty lunacy is fuelled by a combination of methamphetamine and a seriously messed-up childhood. The missions flit between their individual stories and an overarching plotline that involves all three, and it’s a credit to GTA V’s versatility and universal quality that each character has his share of standout missions. As their arcs developed I felt very differently about each of them at different times – they’re not entirely the archetypes that they seem to be.This three-character structure makes for excellent pacing and great variety in the storyline, but it also allows Rockstar to compartmentalise different aspects of Grand Theft Auto’s personality. In doing so, it sidesteps some of the troubling disconnect that arose when Niko Bellic abruptly alternated between anti-violent philosophising and sociopathic killing sprees in GTA IV. Here, many of Michael’s missions revolve around his family and his past, Franklin is usually on call for vehicular mayhem, and extreme murderous rampages are left to Trevor. Each has a special ability suited to his skills – Franklin can to slow time while driving, for example – which gives them a unique touch. Narratively, it’s effective – even off-mission I found myself playing in character, acting like a mid-life-crisis guy with anger issues as Michael, a thrill-seeker as Franklin, and a maniac as Trevor. The first thing I did when Franklin finally made some good money was buy him an awesome car, because I felt like that’s what he’d want.Trevor feels a like a bit of a get-out-of-jail-free card for Rockstar, providing an outlet for all the preposterous antics and murderous behaviour that otherwise might not fit in with GTA V’s narrative ambitions. I found his violent insanity a little overblown and tiresome at first. As get-out clauses go, though, it’s pretty effective, and Trevor’s over-the-top missions are some of GTA V’s action-packed highlights. It’s a successful way of solving a problem that’s prevalent in open-world games: the tension between the story that the writers are trying to tell, and the story you create yourself within its systems and its world. Grand Theft Auto V accommodates both, masterfully, allowing neither to undermine the other. Last but not least Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.",1.0
"I honestly loved this game i couldnt get enough of it, even the endless grinding for money was fun and an experience on its own... But i feel that the game is broken due the last update.

"Hackers everywhere online, until Rockstar get's their head out of their asses don't buy the game unless you wanna deal with a bunch of asshats with god mode and explosive weapons turned on. Don't get me wrong, the game itself is great and very well optimized, but for the time being anything involving multiplay in the game is completely ruined as there's generally 1+ hacker(s) per game session. Client side multiplayer gaming, that doesn't even have a proper anti-cheat, yeah wow great idea. All Rockstar cares about right now is money, they have a pretty complex anti-cheat for money but that's it who cares about the actual gameplay right?",1.0
"So I had a decent review for this game when I first got it years ago, Then I changed my review due to the removal of mods and the ability to mod the game. But now I deleted my previous review and this is a new one, why?As far as I am concerned a cheating system is there to keep away cheaters from the actual legit players wanting to enjoy, or in this case; atleast try to enjoy the game.I downloaded the game AGAIN after i deleted it a year ago because of the new updates in online which got me excited, who doesn't want to buy a new flying car to fly around the city? Now I try to grind a bit and play online and I open the game not 5 minutes from writing this review, to find my account suspended for a month till the 16th of June 2018.So here's the question. What in the actual ♥♥♥♥ happened? Is this game's cheating system just a bunch of random bans to anybody who was playing? And I didn't even find a modder or any cheater within my game when I was playing, hell I didn't even do anything but missions and races.So? I'm♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥off, not because a non fair♥♥♥♥♥♥suspended my account, where in this case other people are also getting banned left and right for no ♥♥♥♥ing reason. But because I didn't get a chance to actually play the online of the game.And for someone who was dying to get their hands on the new cars of the new update or even having a property in game and these kind of stuff, this is seriously ♥♥♥♥ed up to prevent someone from the experience they paid for their game.So for an actual review, the game's singleplayer is good. online is trash because if you think you won't cheat or meet a cheater at any time, this can happen to you for no reason.Don't get it for the online. And even for the singleplayer, the 60 dollars aren't enough for it alone. What a ♥♥♥♥ed up situation.",1.0
"People are getting banned from GTA:O using FOV mods in single player, but actual cheaters get to stay. Cheaters that use invinicibility hacks, and ♥♥♥♥ around with your stuff, and generally make GTA:O a horrible experience. Rockstar continues to ignore the actual problem, but bans innocent people for correcting faults in the game (the FOV setting is TOO LOW, but if you get dizzy and have headaches because of it, well, ♥♥♥♥ you. Also, soon Rockstar is probably going to start banning people for setting up racing wheels using xbox 360 controller emulators, because Rockstar was too lazy to set up joystick and racing wheel support in the first place).In conclusion: No mod support, and if you do mod with good intentions then you get banned.If you hack and cheat: ""Welcome to GTA:Online"" - Rockstar Games",1.0

This is such a shame that TAKE TWO have screwed them selfs in the A#$ with this cease and desist  letter to OPEN IV.

"The money system for Online is ridiculous. Firstly, to start making any real money, you must buy a house with a 10-car garage for a heist room, and work through around 3 heists before you can start pumping out any real $. That being said, the process of linking up with other Online players for startup missions takes forever as people routinely leave during matching, or leave DURING a startup mission and it goes fubar. You have to start all over. Same thing occurs when attempting a heist itself. So, if you do not have any dedicated, no life friends who are willing to spare an hour and a half in the least on startup missions, and 30-45 minutes to do a heist, then you are out of luck. Your GTA Online experience will be awful. I really think Rockstar, instead of just adding more and more insanely priced in-game content, should reavalute their money system and make it less cumbersome to come up with some real dough. Otherwise, all you can hope is to become like the batshit crazy GTA players on the forums who denounce anyone who isn't willing to dedicate their ever-waking hour to this game.",0.0
game worked for about a week and it was awesome and then one day it just stopped getting past the rockstar social club loading screen. i cant even play the story mode.. this is why people pirate games.. maybe i should start doing that instead of giving my money to these companies. ive tried talking to their support team and theyre helpful but they dont know how to help me.. wow waste of my 50 dollars,1.0
"If you had asked me when the game first came out if I would recommend it????  Yes.  And still, their single player is good...however what they did to the players and the economy in the Multiplayer mode is just evil.  The prices on EVERYTHING are ridiculous and you have to grind your life away just to afford anything, or spend a crap ton of REAL CASH on their Shark Cards so you can get the in game items.  Or if you are lucky...find a modder shooting money from a rooftop in an open lobby.  But just trying to play the missions with friends to gain the money you want/need...nope.  It is rediculous the low payout for the rewards and inflated pricing.  RIP GTAV you were the FIRST GTA I purchased and will be the last.  Because your next installment will eventually end up the same way.",1.0
"GTA V is an amazing game but is riddled with modders online and Rockstar doesn't seem to do anything about it. I've reported and blocked many modders but continue to see the same ones. I was minding my own business the other day in passive mode doing stunt jumps and a modder killed me, destroyed my personal vehicle, and crashed my game to the desktop. It's infuriating having to constantly make insurance claims after a modder destroys your personal vehicle while you're in passive mode, and even more infuriating having to constantly find a new session because every lobby seems to have at least one modder at all times.Until they crackdown on modding, I will not recommend this game to anyone looking to play it online.",1.0

"Scrapped my old review. I went from not recommended to yes, I do recommend it, but only for single player.This game is fantastic in singleplayer. I like the story thus far, I love the graphics, I love the gameplay, I love the characters, I love the humor, ... it's all so wonderful. Plenty to do. Runs well too. Plenty of graphical settings to choose in order to get the fps you want, provided you're not running on a toaster/potato.I have near-max settings capped at 30fps (I prefer consistent fps) with an i5 4690K, an ASUS 760 OC, and 8GB RAM. Very enjoyable. WIll be a lot more enjoyable when I get one of those newer cards! ;)However...I would NOT recommend this game for mutliplayer at all, in its current state. Rockstar are overbearing parents and the game is full of hackers and trolls. Not my idea of a good time. I would definitely stay away from GTA5 if your only desire is MP, unless you wanna get banned for doing nothing wrong (seems to happen a lot) or you want to troll people, selfishly screwing up other peoples' fun because you lack integrity.I'm a long time GTA fan. I played the original 2 taht were 2D. I played a lot of GTA 3, VC, and SA both on console and PC. I couldn't get into 4; honestly feel it was a terrible game compared to the others. Mostly, GTA4 runs like garbage on the PC, is full of painful jaggies, and the camera when driving really irked me.",1.0

"So as im writing this, I think I've racked up 130+ Hours in GTA V so far on my PC... yeah I KNOW!!!It's either too much, or not enough! ;)I held back my hype ALOT when the game was announced for the consoles... and even more when it was about to launch for PC... mainly well... i learned from Watch_Dogs, I know... different company... but still... hype is hype non the less. Now GTA V... well it didn't dissapoint ONE BIT, quite frankly now i own it on the PS4 as well, so yeah... the game is marvelous, the characters are well written, the story is amazing, and the ""character switching"" is well amazing.But enough about all that since, well like me, most of you watched the YouTube videos before PC launch.Now the game on PC runs VERY SMOOTH, (compared to GTA IV when it launched) so that was simply a joy to feel, watch and enjoy. The 60fps, the first person well the graphics, everything so far... is amazing to be honest.To sum it up... I gave into the hype, and I got swallowed whole, and I can admit... this game has not dissapointed.I mean come on... the detail that Rockstar has put into this... blows my mind, drive your car through Los Santos, park it in your garage, and listen to the engine cool off, sizzle, or hell even the AC cool off, depending on what type of car you drove. Things like that... simply are amazing and what make a game enjoyable. (At least for me)The Pros:+ Graphics+ Online Part + Heists+ Gameplay+ Story+ Lapdances ;)+ Characters (Franklin, Michael & Trevor)+ Mechanics (Car Modding, Activities etc. etc.)+ Smooth overall feel of the game, no crashes etc.+ Details Details Details honestly, i could list a crapton of stuff to put here.Now the cons:These cons, will only evolve around the Online Part of the game, since well honestly... i have yet to find  alot except 1 thing to stick my finger on when it comes to the Single Player part.Single Player:- No dating crazy women from the dating sites? :D i Remember that in GTA 4, was fun.- No increase in body mass when gaining strength, or for that part, the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional :( (Think of San Andreas, then you know what i mean)GTA Online- Not enough houses to purchase (High-End with heist rooms) i mean come ON we wanna be neighbours to the Playboy Mansion ;)- Stock Market disabled :( (Kinda hope to see that back / activated)- No increase in body mass when gaining strength, or for that part, the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional :( (Think of San Andreas, then you know what i mean)- The heists are fun, but loose re-play value once you do the Elite Challenges, i hope to see more Heists, either in Patch or DLC form.- No animals (well then again think they got removed to reduce lag etc. but still could be fun to go hunting with RPG's :P  )And honestly thats about it... its a honest review, with my own point of view... and ill say this... i will STILL give this a 10/10 why... simply because the game delivers to the hype it recieved... no questions about it.My Gaming/Work Rig:CPU: Intel i7 4770k clocked to 4.5GhzMotherboard: Asus ROG Maximus Hero VIIRam: 32GB DDR3 Kingston Beast 2400mhz RamHarddrives: 2x 256 Samsung SSD+ 2x 500GB Samsung SSD + 2TB 7200RPM External StorageGraphics Card: Asus Nvidia Titan 6GBMonitor: 2x Asus VG278HE 144hz Monitor",1.0

Lets just say im glad i got it on sale at $29.99, as i have grown to hate Take Two and Rockstar recently with the focus of GTA Online and shark cards and such. Not to mention that brief incident with OpenIV. To be completely honest, i got this game only to play a modifcation. LSPDFR is the only reason i even purchased the game, and I'm glad i did because there is never ending content and the modification community works harder than any Developer at these studios do.

"GTA V - Singleplayer ReviewFirst Draft, Version 1Clocking out at 102 hours at the time of writing and this without any GTA Online counted, as I have not yet started Online even once.IntroductionTo be fair, Grand Theft Auto needn't a big introduction to most people as it is a huge and ifluential title. But nontheless I shall give it a quick rundown. So what is Grand Theft Auto V? Well some people say it's a sandbox. Some call it a quasi-actionrpg. Some just stick with third person shooter. And non is really wrong either, it takes elements from most genres and bangs them together to make them work. And they really do. It's a game that gives the player immense freedom, you can either go full psycho and kill everything that moves, steal cars, kill animals and so on or you can go play golf. This is just an example, but the stark contrast is there. And this is the thing that makes 'GTA' one of the most successful franchises of all time. The freedom of doing whatever the hell you please is a satisfying thing indeed. Story (Spoiler free)In this game you're introduced to three protagonists, a ""hood gangster"", a retired bank robber, and well frankly, a psychopath. In a series of events these three become connected and their three seperate stories become entwined into one in one of the most interesting ways I personally have ever experienced in a video game. At first I was not very impressed in fact, but that might be because you start off as humble as this game gets, a gangster. This alone is not a problem, but I was generally put off by the fact that what felt was every third word was ""♥♥♥♥♥"".  And yes, I am aware that this games plays on stereotypes and that in fact it is very common, but it still felt silly after 5 minutes. Get past the small things however and youll find a rich and fleshed out story set in a great setting with immaculate attention to detail.MiscAs I mentioned in the introduction there is for example golf to play. Well that's not all. There's all kinds of side activities ranging from street racing to tennis, from hitting money transports to getting ""attention"" in gentlemen clubs. It's a universe filled with things for you to do, things to occupy you and this is one of Grand Theft Auto V's greatest features.Pros- Great combat.- Immersive gameplay.- A ludicrous amount of features.- Extreme attention to detail.- Fleshed out story.- Fun side activites.- It's able to mix humor and seriousness in a way only Rockstar can do.- Great music. - Superb customization for both vehicles and characters.- Impressive graphics.- Near perfect voice-acting on almost all characters (including pedestrians and random AI)Cons- Some dialog feels a bit forced.- I personally encountered bugs when tabbing out of the game crashing it, but this might be due to other issues.- During my 102 hours of gameplay my game crashed thrice. This is not as much as of a con as a general ""fyi info"".- Flying controls suck really bad. - If a cutscene is accidentally skipped I found no other way than to kill myself to cancel the mission and then restart it from the beginning. As you can tell, most of these are really just nitpicking. The only real problem I had with this game was the flying controls. Flying helicopters was just the most infuriating thing I did in this.SummaryIt's bloody brilliant. Definately in the top ten best games of all time. When I finished the story at 83 hours in, I couldnt stop myself from keep playing. Yet I found another 20 hours before I felt I could say that I am done with the singleplayer. And I have not even completed it to 100% yet. So do I recommend it? Maybe a tiny little bit. Maybe a tiny tiny little bit. Buy it if you like good games. I'm done here.",1.0

Come on guys, this is taking the P!ss, you can easily transfer this for us with no issues..Secondly, the attacking of OpenIV meaning we can no longer MOD the game is such a selfish move, possibly becuase of your delaying of porting Red Dead Redemption to PC, people are resorting to modding it over and you're insecure about this, possibly becuase you're working on the second instalment and you want to maximise profits.

"This will be my second ever review of any game, I am reviewing GTA 5 because I am done playing it. let's begin!when I first got this game I was wondering if it would even run on my archaic PC, much to my surprise and pleasure, it ran smooth enough. I started GTA online shortly after finishing a few campaign missions with memories of playing it once before. I have a lot of great stories from my time online, and it actually consumed a lot of my free time. There was a point where I thought it would be great to build my own military faction and rule the game, but over time that degraded into grinding jobs with my close friends, one of whom I met IN the game. all around, I can reccomend this game to people who can enjoy the free roam elements in offline play for most of the time, because the online play has mass banning waves every few months. I bring this up because I have been perma banned today after a run in in a public server, so I cannot play anymore. all around, if you intend to buy this for the online play, don't pay full price, wait for a sale.  I rate this game a 6/10 for online play and an 8/10 for offline play, I also rate the modding for the offline play a 6/10   because of needing to update the mods every few weeks. overall I do believe I got my moneys worth, but I don't think a lot of other players who get banned early on would aggree.  if you read this whole thing through, feel free to leave commentary.",1.0

"Before you dismiss my negative review on basis of OpenIV, or my 300 hour+ playtime, I'd like to start by saying GTA V used to be good once upon a time.The online was really fun, and all the DLC has been ""free"" so far. The problem is that after Benzies left they abandoned their best feature - the heists. They just kept pumping out lower and lower quality content that required more and more grinding to play. It's like playing an MMORPG that you can only upgrade in by putting in 10-20x the normal time for an MMO, or by directly spending real life money on the game. They only care about money at this point. Which is ludicrious as they would have made a boat load of money with a single player expansion or two. The content could be intergrated into Online too to give them some extra cash on the cheap. But they do the opposite, they intentionally don't put any new online content into the single player as they want you to grind/buy shark cards online, and it's much easier to get money on singleplayer through mods and stock market.Gunrunning DLC and the OpenIV debacle pretty much sealed the deal for me in the end.",1.0

"First of all: This game is a loading simulator. I really like/ love the game but I don't recommend the game anymore.You need to wait a very long time before the game actually loads online. No, this is not my internet connection since all my friends are dealing with the same issue. When you've finished a heist or mission you can expect loading simulator again.I've made a list why I don't recommend GTA V at the moment:- It's loading simulator.- They are all about the sharkcards.- All the new cars etc are way to pricy to get all the items legit, except if you buy a sharkcard.- They do ban you for no reason (I has this once) and they won't remove your ban, sometimes life just sucks.Maybe you can see it in the hours I played GTA V but I still enjoy the game. I can't give a positive feedback because of the things I wrote above. I do love the gunrunning update, it gives some more content to the game (but as I said above, all the new items are freaking expensive).It's crazy that the game is (on steam) still for €60 so don't you dare buy it for €60.

Now I had no cheating device installed but like everyone played in servers where people cheat. It is unavoidable. After calling them and explaining I didn't get I was read the same lame excuse of You ID will be banned for 30 days. I waited the 30, begrugdingly. I deleted the game and did a fresh install. Started a new charactor since Rockstar deleted my old one, and started to build my empire again from the ground up. 40ish hours in I received a notice telling me I have been perminately banned for cheating. Again I tried calling Rockstar telling them I will submit any files they need to prove I wasn't cheating, I was informed they have algarythms that detect it so I was definately cheating. I have never used OpenIV, had any mods installed, or any programs that allow cheating, yet now my Rockstar account is banned on all games past present and future from online play.

"I have to say somethings really do surprise me... (Note this is about Grand Theft Auto Online Just an FYI in case you don't want to Read) I have been avoiding the Public Matches for a very very long time ever since it was first released back in late 2013...  (originally on PS3) everyone is so hostile and so angry and they are dubbed ""The Most Toxic Gaming communities ever...""and I was doing a bit of research on it and how to make more... In game currency... and the only way was though the Public sessions...So me watching the videos... I said whats the point in all of that I'll never accomplish anything Players are so hostile they turn Los Santos in to a Damned war zone... this being quite a bit of time ago... last night I was playing on GTA online and everything that I want in that game can be bought by purchasing In world currency... or by earning it... so I went back to Youtube and i was watching videos and people had cash on them that was possibly worth if you... could extract the money from the game pretty close to $100 - $200 Dollars US Currency... and I said to myself There is no way once so ever I am going to be earning that but they say you never know unless you Try so I have decided to step out of my comfort zone a bit and give it a Try.... I have to say the Risk is worth the reward... when I first started playing I felt Stress and all kinds of negative emotions barring down upon me... and I just kept it cool played solo for a bit did my own thing and avoided any other players as much as possible... and I accomplished so much out of it... not only that I sorta Came over the Fear of what I thought was being subjected to a bad community... honestly its not as bad as I always thought it was. 8.5/10",0.0

"WARNING: The following is an actual (kind of) review of Grand Theft Auto V, unlike my other reviews!----------Here we go.Grand Theft Auto V is the fifth installment - obviously - of the GTA series, released by Rockstar Games. The story mode centres upon three indivisuals; Trevor Philips, Michael De Santa, and Franklin Clinton. The 'story' generally consists of them entering - and returning to - the life of crime. Through out the 'story', the three protagonists deal with the hardships and gains from being a criminal. This 'story' is actually better than it seems. It is very fun and, for the first half only, very addictive. However, it gets really boring after about 2-3 weeks of playing the game. And once it gets boring, you - or at least I - won't find that spark that lit the fire of addictiveness that drove you to play GTA V for hours on end in the first place. Furthermore, this game crashes. A lot. For me at least, I am lucky to even get past the loading screen without crashing. As for the online mode, I haven't really took a gander at it at all. So the following will be objective. Online mode is fun only up to an extent. If you are new to online mode - or GTA V for that matter - you will be lost, confused, and you will die. A lot. As well, and I cannot be certain about this, Rockstar Games decided to remove modding in GTA V. For some, not me, this was the driving factor that made them addicted to the game in the first place.To conclude, when you play this game for the first time, you will be in awe. This is due to the fact that GTA V is a visual masterpiece and a landmark in gaming. The close attention to detail is significantly evident. As stated before, you will probably get bored within a month of playing the game. And once you do, I wouldn't advise you to switch to online mode as that can - not only be more boring as you are somewhat stripped of your freedom due to the endless killing that will occur, but can be frustrating. And good luck with the consistent crashing that may occur. Oh yeah, the game has♥♥♥♥♥♥in it.Verdict: 5.2/10",1.0

If you don't have friends then about half of the time playing will be spent in loading screens. I hate to admit that I will play it, a lot, but I will dislike rockstar more for every day I play.

"""He sits on his ♥♥♥ all day, smoking dope and jerking off while he plays that ♥♥♥♥ing game. If that's our standard for goodness... then no wonder this country's screwed."" - Michael De SantaSTORY (No Spoilers)Grand Theft Auto V pits the player into the roles of the three main protagonists: Michael, a married man suffering from a midlife crisis, Franklin, a gangster trying to make a change for himself, and Trevor, who's just a Canadian psychopath. The trio get together and perform all sorts of daring heists and escapades.The game is action-packed with chases, gang shootouts, and intense heists that get crazier as the game goes on.When you're not robbing a convenience store or shooting rednecks, you can partake in all sorts of activities. You can walk your dog—Chop, go golfing, play tennis, and even get a lap dance at the strip club (Sorry Roman, there's no bowling)!GTA ONLINE:The GTA Online Protagonist can be created according to the taste of the player to customize (gender or appearance). The player will choose a gender, then choose the parents and grandparents of the character to affect his/her appearance. Then, the player chooses how much the character spends his/her daily life; this will create the initial stats for the character and slightly change the appearance.After you have finished creating your character, you arrive in Los Santos with an open welcome by Lamar Davis (Especially if you're a female). He then has you do a street race with him (and other new players, if available), and shows you to Gerald, a drug runner who'll give you easy jobs to start you off in Los Santos. After you complete this tutorial, you'll join a free roam session with up to 32 other players (Who'll either become your friend or your enemy).Final VerdictIn retrospect, I give Grand Theft Auto V a 9/10+ Amazing story+ Excellent gameplay+ Fun with friends, and fun without them!+ Great graphics+ GTA Editor+ Heists are fun and replayable for more cash- Glitches""Now go!

"Despite the delay, a true masterpieceRockstar f'ed up the PC version of GTAIV - even in 2015 it's still an unoptimized buggy turd. However, GTA was and always will be a great game. The strength of the modding community is a sign of this - even the buggy unoptimized GTAIV has an enviable library of mods, particularly real-life cars (the main reason I play GTA on PC and not on console).However, they slowly started to regain my faith with Max Payne 3 - a surprisingly well optimized game that ran great at 1080p near-maxed (except MSAA was off) on a 1GB GTX560 non-Ti. I've since upgraded to a 4GB GTX760 Superclocked, and since GTAV and Max Payne 3 have similar engines, it comes as no surprise that GTAV runs like a dream!Optimization is superb. Full 4k resolution support (sadly I don't have a 4k display), highly scalable even on an Intel IGP (yes, I tested it on my ultrabook - it runs better than the X360/PS3 versions), keyboard/mouse controls that feel fluid and responsive (especially the driving), full action-replay support, a new first-person interface developed exclusively for PC and next-gen consoles, and just jaw-droppingly beautiful graphics. It's hard to believe that the same studio did GTAIV's port.The gameplay is the same old GTA we know and love, set in sunny Los Santos, San Andreas (an obvious parody of Los Angeles, California). It takes a less serious tone than GTAIV did, especially when Trevor Phillips (the world's greatest fictional Canadian, bar none) is involved. I simply can't stress enough how awesome Trevor is. Just Google him. He should be the virtual spokesman for GTAV. I have heard negative things about GTA Online but I have not tried it nor do I plan to. Thus I will make no opinion about it. Overall, the two-year wait was well worth it. As of October 2015, real-life car mods have made their way into the game and I'm going to spend more time than ever playing it.",1.0

"This game took and still takes up a large portion of what could otherwise be called my life. 10/10 would put my real-life relationships to the test again.edit June 2017: So I have mixed feelings about what Take2 did in terms of getting rid of mods, but regardless I HAVE to overturn my review to negative because I could not in good conscience recommend anyone still buy this game and start from scratch, let alone for the price it still has. I'm not saying I would've recommended that anyone take on cheater-money to be able to afford stuff in the game before the update, but it seems like now not only will people not be able to mod the game offline anymore (which I find atrocious but it doesn't hurt me as an online-player very much), new players will (as of now) be expected to pay full price for the game and be met with a plethora of content that they wouldn't be able to afford even if they doubled-up their initial expenses by going for the largest shark-card option. 8 million get you nowhere in this game, and with the latest update Rockstar once again ensured that the moneymaking-possibilities will be slow enough that even if GTA Online was free to play (which of course it isn't) at this point it would basically be pay to win (especially for new players) because there's weapon modifications in the game now that give you a major advantage but they take either a huge amount of money (think 4mil) and lots of time to acquire, or a humongous amount of money (think 14mil) and lots of clicking on a button.Of course the intention of introducing explosive bullets as a legit part of the game was to take away the huge advantage fighter-jets had in the past, but besides all the other new weapon-improvements this also means it's now very easy for someone who has played this game a bunch to grief players who are just trying to make money, which they HAVE to do in public sessions where you are thrown together with others.To reiterate, I think the main thing that kept people coming back to the online-portion of the game, especially after an update, was that it was relatively easy to get some illegitimate money to be able to afford the new stuff. Of course that's not in the interest of Rockstar and Take2 to give these ""free"" DLCs out for free. But to crack down on the entirety of the modding-community which for the most part hasn't even been about modding GTA Online is, like I said, atrocious. Rockstar took over 2 years to continually fail at making GTA Online for PC cheater-proof. Others can do it, but all they could do was send their lawyers and corporate powers after everyone who played a major role in enabling others to modify GTA V (!= GTA Online). And even if mods do come back eventually, which wouldn't surprise me, the argument still remains that GTA Online has been pruposely turned into and kept a money-grind which you can only legally ""overcome"" by throwing even more money down the throats of Take2 and Rockstar.Since I assume that hardly anyone would still buy this game for the vanilla offline-portion of the game, as I said, I cannot in good conscience still recommend anyone buy this game anymore.",1.0

"Something I can't stress enough, if a game is already two years old it should not be the price of a new game.You can say ""Online gets free updates all the time"" but in truth you'll find that these updates of ""FREE"" new content is nearly always going to require either 30-40+ hours of purely farming ingame money non-stop for a small portion of the actual update or spending ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of actually earned money in order to see what SOME of the content from these so-called free DLC's have to offer. TL;DR ~ 40+ hours of your life grinding away nonstop, or more than $200 for the most recent Gunrunning DLC  going the cheapest, non-upgrading route, meaning: no weapon upgrades, no spending on research, no alternate vehicle upgrades, cheapest bunker w/ no upgrades, cheapest Mobile Operation Center truck (Which does include vehicle and weapon workshops along with command center, although being redundant in this case) Let's take the most recent Gunrunners update as an example: $14,670,000 is the total cost of most vehicles with no upgrades, cheapest bunker with no upgrades (No production upgrades, no security, no personal quarters, no transportation, no gunrange, just the base setup) the mobile operation center w/ the cheapest truck, the vehicle and weapon workshop, and command center (This does not include clothing with the exception of the Ballistic Equipment, or weapon upgrades and the research required to retrieve them, or the modifications to vehicles or research also required for them) $14,670,000 is equivelant to, if going purely on the idea that you already are capable of being a VIP which now requires you to have $50,000 in the bank at any time, $200 i.e. 2 Megalodon Shark Cards will be required. Now if you wanted to do this legitlimately on the basis that you already own a decent money making building say for instance a car warehouse and let's just, although this is nigh impossible, say you have all the Top Grade vehicles to sell, always paying the $20,000 to take it to the specialist dealer, netting you $80,000 each time and this is to assume that you somehow never damage the vehicles you deliver. Say it somehow takes you 5 minutes to deliver, a MANDATORY waiting period of approximately 16 minutes, and restocking let's say takes 8 minutes and we'll say you immediately begin restocking so as to remove 8 minutes from the 16 minute waiting time, and we'll also say you always get back a top range vehicle. So that's 14,670,000/80,000 which is 183.375. Multiply that by the minutes you have: 13 and you get around 2383 minutes or rounded up to about 40 hours of purely vehicle work non-stop (And once more this is purely assuming that you gather the vehicles without taking any losses, which is almost entirely impossible, and always taking only 8 minutes to get a new vehicle and not damaging it, again being almost impossible, always getting top-tier vehicles, and never losing any cash when delivering vehicles aswell as always delivering in 5 minutes.)So in truth, a very small portion of one of the most recent ""FREE"" DLC's is equivelant to approximately more than 40 hours of your life purely grinding away, or around $200 if you pay for it. How's that for FREE? How great of Rockstar to give us all this FREE content, right?I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done.",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V, for the most part, is not a great game. I wouldn't even go so far as to say its a good game. It is, in some aspects, fun and entertaining - as any great game should be - but in many more aspects, dull, tedious, and so unenjoyable at times that I feel ashamed to put myself through another second. The game's greatest moments are without a doubt its heists featuring exciting and elaborate team-based action that incorporates the best bits of the game rolled into a small session of gameplay. But, unfortunately, all the buildup made to get to those moments both online and off are excruciatingly boring and often just plain packaged filler, unoriginal context, and repatative grinding: shoot, drive, buy, repeat. While the game is a huge step up from its predecessor in terms of gameplay and aesthetics, it has no flare for storytelling nor decent character arcs. The game often feels as though more time was put into allowing the player to experience basic life experiences like playing tennis, or golf, or watching TV, or riding on a roller coaster than actually developing an engrossing story none of us would be able to even envision happening in real life. And while some things like infiltrating bases and racing cars where fun in the moment I never felt like they amounted to anything by the latter part of my experience.Online is an entirely different story all together. There is a huge emphasis on cooperative play and is excellently crafted in that it allows players to come together in heists or destroy each other in gang wars however they see fit. Online, there is an amazingly and often surprisingly fun time to be had. But it is most certainly not without problems - major ones at that. Rockstar, the studio responsible for the development of GTA V, enjoys money. We all do. It cannot be faulted until it reaches such a ridiculous point that we can only look in disbelief and dismay. A point they reached online. Items in-game are ludicrously expensive compared to how much money you earn and the only way to stock yourself with the best cars, weapons, and equipment is to grind endlessly for money to get a single item or to pay real money from your real wallet to buy Shark Cards. Yep. Thats right. It's pay to win and the spending is not at all exclusive to cosmetics - which I would be fine with if it was. Players get an unfair edge if they're willing to pay more on in-game currency and Rockstar is just raking in the extra $$$ from it. But there's also another way for players to get an unfair edge online. Hacking. The game is full of it. At this point it would save Rockstar more face to come out and say there are no anti-cheating safeguards than to say they have such a mind-numbingly poor and incompetent system of combating hackers as they do now. Additionally, although it has not happened to me nor do I expect it - partly because I willl not continue to play the game - there are numerous reports of players getting banned despite not having cheated and only for having single-player only mods or recieveing unsolicited in-game currency from hackers.The humour, or lackthereof, is something that almost made me want to get up and stretch for a bit when a cutscene came on for the main story - something you never want to feel in a game. You want to be constantly engrossed. You want to feel excited about what is going to happen next in a game when a cutscene appears and then more excited when it ends and its time to kick♥♥♥♥♥ Whenever it was time to fill the story with a cutscene the only resonse I could muster was to brace for the incoming out-of-place crude jokes. Not that there is anything wrong with the calibre of political incorrectness thrusted at you in the game from the word go but when it is done so often that it is expected in every sentence, there is no comedic value by the end of the first hour of gameplay save for the occasional scene. Some say the game's story is a satirical commentary on the American Dream just like the last, only I can't help but point out that satire is supposed to  provoke thought through comedy and make an audience aware of the extant aspects of some social or political concept  while evoking heartfelt laughter. GTA V has jokes based on social media to reality TV to drug abuse and promiscuity but there dosn't seem to be any point, thus denouncing itself as being a satirical game.There are great moments to be had in the game especially online, discounting some unfortunately common problems, in terms of its gameplay and fun, if unoriginal, mechanics. There is no particular charm or wit offered by Grand Theft Auto V, only another installment in a series of invariably humourous and pointless gags but can be a very fun game to play with a few friends online once in a while.38/100",1.0
The Game is fun and the graphics is a big improvement the control of the vehicle is so much better. GTA 5 Online is fun and have heist that let you earn fast money it is so far the best game on Rockstar. $74.90 is worth but i bought it after the Pre-order Kind of sad but at least i earn money via the heist,1.0
"Single player is really nice and all, and it might even be worth buying the game for just single player (if you like broken mechanics), but just because online is incredibly bad, filled with cheaters tryhards and pay to win on one of the best selling games ever I am giving this a negative review would have ben better if I never bought it.",0.0
"I will be honest, the only good thing about this game is single player. The humor is amazing, the story line is kick a** and decision based as well... What really grinds my gears is multiplayer, and the fact that Rockstar has no sympathy towards their community. There are false ban reports being ignored, massive waves of modders over taking servers without getting removed, everything is over-priced and over-played (Literally, when I say over-played I can't emphasize it enough. Once you played all the heists (including doomsday) you will get sick of this game.) as well as Rockstar basically forcing Shark cards down our throats because ""If you don't buy this you won't make it."" Sadly, this game has become a pi**ing contest, whoever has the best sh*t gets respected and has authority over others. It's ridiculous, really. Not even worth 60$ with how over-priced the damn cards are. I would only ever recommend buying this garbage on G*2*A, or wait till' they decide to throw it on a steam sale.I'll repeat this, SINGLEPLAYER is really the only great thing about this garbage truck of a game. And for Christ's sake, PLEASE don't give in to spending half your paychecks on a shark card...",1.0

"GTA V is the first game of the GTA series that I played, and I have to say its single player story mode is one of the best games I have ever played. What I liked:- very interesting story line with its three different characters- stunning eye for detail, which shows in interaction with people, environment, voice acting, physics (driving is better than some so-called racing games)- great customisation options for cars- vibrant city, with all NPCs going about their business; Los Santos is very much alive- excellent graphics and performance (there were only very few occasions where it dipped below 60 fps)- variety of missions, which never feel repetitive- huge choice of weapons and vehicles- good sense of humour both in story cutscenes as well as NPCsWhat spoiled the experience a little:- you spend a lot of time picking cars up from the impound, because a mission forces the personal vehicle on you and impounds your current vehicle behind the scenes- random spawn points after character switch, while sometimes funny, can get a tad annoying- bugs in the garage system have you lose your vehicle (stolen or purchased alike) on occasion- it doesn't matter which clothes you put on, because on character switch the game might decide that you wear something else (even if not on a mission)These are all tiny details in the big picture though. The single player experience is fantastic. I wish it was a bit longer. As for the online part of the game, it feels like an afterthought, so I'm not really going to take that into the rating. Everybody is going berserk, and there's no really goal apart from levelling up by doing the same things over and over. My impression is that it mainly serves as a source of extra money for Rockstar.Story Mode is a lot more captivating!Overall verdict, without taking GTA Online into account: 9.9/10",1.0

How to ruin an awesome game: Microtransactions and kill the mods.. Great job Take two...,1.0
"Good and fun game. What else to say? Online mode is fun with friends specially when playing the heists. Beware: GTA Online requires grinding for money (GTA$) if you wanna get the cool stuff, so it obviously requires time or you to buy Shark Cards with REAL money to get millions of GTA$. So, this money is important for Rockstar/Take Two interactive but it's also important for the game, because part of this real money is what keeps the game going and receiving updates/DLC. The game has big vulnerabilities because it does not have an effective built in anti-cheat/hack engine (if it ever had one), it's also somewhat unstable during online gameplay with Heists being ruined with disconnects and glitches/bugs.GTA has always been fun and great with the modding scene, with mostly single player mods, or even multiplayer mods but that don't run or affect official GTA online servers. However, side effect is that same mod tools that allow great mods to exist also can be used by cheaters to obtain fake money (GTA$) in GTA Online, and cause disruptive gameplay (god mod, remove people's vehicles, guns, teleport them elsewhere, etc). That is because the game has vulnerabilies, and not because the mod tool exists. Nothing is stopping someone else to develop a new tool that will keep ruining the game and possibly creating losses of profits for Take Two Interactive.Obviously the mod tools intended use is not for cheating or gaining ""illegal""/fake GTA$ money, but in order to protect their game and profits, Take Two interactive decided to send a cease and desist letter to a popular mod tool (Open IV) site to stop developing and distributing the software that is essentially the base for all mods. Instead of fixing their game and creating mechanisms that block those illegal exploits, they decide to target the modding community. TL;DR: Because of a few deranged people, they ruin it for everyone.They have the right to protect their game, but they should act more professionally and considerate of the large user base that likes GTA because of the legit mods.Due to a lot of protest and public outcry Take Two has decided to re-evaluate the issue and allow the mod tool to be distributed and supported. The modding community can breathe again!",1.0
"This is my re-edited version of the game, at first I recommended the game because it was truly fun with MODS. I had so much fun with mods (to the point where I got carried away with it) that my game has crashed 7 times, and forcing me to buy a new flash drive devoted for backing up my game.  As a console gamer, I played this game since day 1 when it came out in 2013 on my old PS3, so I can safely assume that I've done everthing in this game already. It truly makes me sad, that you can longer mod in GTA V since I did plan on making another short using mods.  As of right now, I do not recommend this game if you're only getting it for mods.",1.0
"The magnitude of the map and just how open the world is for exploration and causing chaos makes the game extremely fun even with no goal or mission at all. The port is very well done and plays well.

"Not gonna bother on the single player experience as its the same for everyone, as for the online part I'll try to share as much as I can. The online part of GTA is loads of fun, just you doing your thing until some bastard in a hydra blows you up. But I can't say much as that's part of the online experience. After hours of grinding you're gonna get bored real fast, everything in the online version costs so much money! Even after doing 1 heist you still won't have enough cash to buy literally anything! Its a total grindfest and it gets stale real quick. If you're planning to buy GTA for the online content be prepared to grind for hours just to get one car or a house, we can't really blame rockstar on this as every DLC they give us is free and they're still providing us with new content for a 3 year old game. So I guess if your not into grinding you'll have to buy the sharkcards or hire a modder and probably get banned. That's basically Gta5 online. I'll give a 7/10.",1.0

"PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE REVIEWThis is a review on GTA Online, not GTA V's amazing story and quality.Yesterday I player GTA: Online for the first time and met some players DANNEKING and davud7984. We were trying to get away from players rapidAlucardtext & Shartankss. Then a scriptkid modder came to us and was ruining the game for everyone. Spamming AI with RPG's, using God Mode, Higher Jumping, Unlimited Ammo, Propspawning and eventually got us (or at least me) banned from GTA: Online when spawning in money above me and my friend. The day after I sent a message to Rockstar Support and I hoped they could help me as soon as possible since I wanted to play the game.I also suggest them to 'fix' their Anti-Cheat since other players are getting banned because of cheaters. I could get many people banned with these scripts and it only costs a lot of money because every hour (or less) a player is banned because of this and demands to be unbanned because a scriptkid is using cheats to ruin the GTA: Online experience for others.So this is the result:I opened a support ticket and asked to get me unbanned, the cancerous support had an automated system saying all bans and suspensions are final. Now if you want to play online, get in mind everyone instantly kills each other and everyone is constantly spamming in microphone, modding/exploiting/cheating and you can get banned by any cheater instantly.Rockstars Support is pure cancer and they are not even trying to help us and get rid of the real cheaters.

"In this review of Grand Theft Auto V I will explain all the details of this game.• PART 1 - The CommunityThe GTA V community is complete trash (Just want to put that out there). Every single individual that plays the game is either a tryhard or a little toxic degenerate that has nothing better to do other than to waste your time. Don't even bother with them as you will have a very difficult time trying to reason with them. The worst people are toxic tryhards, now that's something you don't want to face.• PART 2 - The grind, (Cheaters)Everyone in the GTA V community knows that getting money and RP is difficult. Everyone also knows that grinding money and RP legit is a joke. So it's guaranteed you'll either find three types of cheaters. They are some legit people though, but it's more common to see a cheater then a legit person grinding.i) The nice one - Friendly to the players by offering money. usually gets banned fast though.ii) The trolling♥♥♥♥♥♥- Dumbasses that like to fool around and♥♥♥♥♥♥off others.iii) The devil of cheaters - In other words, they're toxic and love to make others lose their minds. (They also deny cheating right infront of the whole lobby)• PART 3 - My personal opinion on the gameI personally love this game. It's balanced in some aspects, but every game has some broken thing about it. Other than that really it's enjoyable with friends or even alone. When none of my friends are one I tend to join random heists and help out others. The GTA V devs add FREE dlc and so no one can complain about that. If this game was 14 years old, I'd still come back and play it, maybe not as much but I'd still play it and remember old memories.Thank you for reading my review. If you are considering buying the game, give it a shot. But don't say I didn't warn you. There are A LOT of toxic degenerates waiting to make you angry.",0.0

"If only R* separated the Online game from GTA V this would have worked out well, but nope. they failed to listen to what Bethesda said and did with TES series; Skyrim and Online far apart.

But saying that, some people who brings all of the modding/hacking to Online is the reason why T2 decides to take the red pill.

This Game is probably the greatest game I have ever played in my life. It keeps you coming back for more and the new updates get lots of hype and never disappoint. I have lots of fun both online and offline. The only problem I have with this game is online is to much of a grind and a cash grab. If you don’t have any real world money to spend on gta you cannot get anything new and you would have to spend hours grinding for cash. People who can spend money just sail right through everything. anytime something new arrives they can just buy it while regular players have to spend months or days. Aside from that this game is very good. I would give it a 9/10 if I was a critic and that is what most critics gave it. This game feels very real and that is why players keep coming back for more fun.,1.0
"This game runs like absolute garbage. I purchased this game from gamestop for the PS3 and waited at midnight for it and loved every minute of the game on console. If I had a current gen console I would have re-purchased it and waited at midnight again. That's what I attempted to do with the PC version. I have the EXACT reccomended specs and I get unplayable stuttering after 20-30 minutes of gameplay. The FPS will drop to literally 2-3 FPS and shoot back up to the usual 20-30. I should mention that when I first load up the game, it runs a perfectly smooth 60 FPS but due to a memory leak that Rockstar has yet to adress or even acknowledge exists it gradually drops until the stuttering starts. Every update they release seems to make my playtime drop about 5 minutes. It actually got slightly better after they removed the junk code designed to keep mods out of multiplayer but they've updated it about 5 times (as of writing) since then and each one has made my FPS worse. I wish I could refund this and get my wasted 60 dollars back.Update: I recently upgraded my graphics card to a GTX 970 and it seems to have fixed every issue I had with the game except for one. Rockstar's horrible customer service. I still haven't gotten an answer to my support tickets submitted in the above review. STILL. I honestly can't recommend this game in good conscience simply because if you have an issue with the game running properly or not running at all, Rockstar simply WILL NOT offer any support. After going on to their support forums, Rockstar employee's are basically extinct and the only people answering questions are 10 year olds telling you to 'get good' or 'fix your toaster'. Even submitting a support ticket either gets you completely ignored or told it's your computer's fault even though it probably isn't.If you're 100% sure your computer will handle this game fine, then by all means do what you will, but if you have any doubt in your mind that it will run, stay away because you're not getting any support here.",1.0

"Rockstar and it's superior Take-Two has taken legal action against software known as OpenIV. It is generally used for modding games in the GTA franchise. Its modding capabilities only apply to the single player mode. It is incapable of providing or helping to install cheats for GTA V multiplayer. Despite this, Take-Two has Taken-To banning people from the game for using mods in the single player mode. Discouraging modding in single player earns them money by forcing players into the multiplayer mode of the game to continue enjoying new content. This new content is often only unlocked when you have absurdly large amounts of in-game money which can only realistically be obtained by purchsing in-game money with real money (Shark Cards). In order to unlock everything in GTA V multiplayer, you would have to spend over $1000 (if not far more) on in-game currency.

"Well, I suppose it's time. Time to review...Grand Theft AutoWhere do I start? The game is overall... Just great.The campaign is pretty long, with a bunch of interesting and unique people, there's plenty of stuff to do even after the main storyline and a lot of toys to play with. I'm currently on my 2nd playthrough of the campaign and it still feels fresh and new. But anyway, enough with the campaign. It's time for the real attraction in my opinion. It's time for...GTA OnlineAhhh GTA Online. A breath of fresh air for me after I finished the campaign. When I clicked the ""Play GTA Online"" button for the first time, I was promted by a character creation screen. After creating a character, I was in the game! After I completed the tutorial, I was in my first freeroam lobby. At first I was unsure of what to do. After playing the campaign, I was expecting a big red ""DO THIS THING"" sign pointing me in the right direction. However, I did not see any. The first major flaw with GTA Online in my opinion, is that it doesn't really give you any tips. It just chucks you in to the lobby, says ""Have fun kid!"" and then leaves you to yourself. My advice to you is this: play races, PvP missions or any other jobs, get a high end apartment and do heists. Once you have a bit of money, buy a CEO office or a bunker and starting getting better money! Anyway, I've been rambling. Better wrap this up.Do I Recommend This Game?Yes. Just yes. Ab-so-lutely.My Rating9.5 / 10 Would buy a flying jet bike and do backflips again.",1.0

"I would absoluteley recommend this game if it wasn't for one thing - hackers. Since day one this game was infested with hackers on an unimaginable scale. The punishment for first offenders was a time ban and that's it. You wouldn't even lose all your cars or the stuff you bought with the cheated money if it has been your first offense. But afer they changed that some hacker sstarted giving money to everyone, hoping this would mask their own second accounts but what hell broke loose... If you happen to get money from them and it's your first time - time ban. But guess what happens afer you get into the second hackerlobby. If you're  lucky, its another time ban for 30 days. Some of my friends weren't so lucky. They got perma banned for being subjected to hackers. So, rockstar - a once great great game studio I loved, can't manage the amount of loopholes and hackers, so it punishes everyone and won't even listen to complaints which propably means there are barely no logs whatsoever, so they can't even look up who cheated or how it happened. Only that some person got money for no reason and ban them for it. Rockstar, srsly? Please go back to your old ways, lead yourself out of this darkness and become great once again. I would hate to lose you guys to the world of I don't give a ♥♥♥♥ companies dishing out ♥♥♥♥♥♥ tripple a titles like electronic arts. Your fan since Gta and Max Payne, Chris.",1.0
"This game's excellent single player is definitely worth the money. Unfortunately the online support (or should I say the lack of) from Rockstar is appalling. Constant bans, retracting of online currency, lack of action against actual problematic players make the online aspect quite literally unplayable due to the amount of time you have to invest in progress. Should you decide to pour hours and hours of your free time into the online, expect it to suddenly disappear even if you somehow have never run into modders and not modded yourself. I have had friends send tickets to R* asking for help to check their accounts in every way and see that no modding or account abuse has occured, only to have them send them copy-paste answers and ignore any request for help. I loved this game's online, but don't play it anymore out of fear of it being the greatest waste of my time.",1.0

"Most of the steam reviews only complain about Online and don't mention anything much about single player or give a good serious review.I will review only single player and say this game is about criminals commiting crimes, causing chaos and death, it's open world with great well written characters, story, excellent voice acting and good gameplay. But it is pretty graphic and content is a bit disturbing. It's violent, with killing, drugs and depicts sexual acts and has strippers and is rated R 18+ in Australia. I don't have a problem with that though. This game is definitely a AAA title and is well made in every aspect, but is still not without bugs and problems.Things I hate and no one warns you about: don't bother buying a garage or moddifying cars, I spent a lot put cars in garage, do a few missions and the cars I put in the garage are no longer there. Happens with every character. Extremely annoying and frustrating.The only cars that actually save and never disappear are the crappy cars the characters start with.Don't bother wasting your money on expensive cars and moddifying them as they never save and just end up disappearing, with no way to get them back.There is no point of spending heaps on a car at all if you can't use it to travel anywhere? You always have to take it home again, and if you walk 50 ft away it disappears before you can do a thing at your destination.At least in San Andreas you had multiple safe houses across the map, so you could store your nice cars at your destination if you wanted to use them for traveling. I am very disappointed with the vehicle saving system as it stands. And that's not even taking the bug that just deletes cars from the garages into consideration. It just bothers me that I can not use my bought and paid for vehicles for the purpose of transportation. Only short joyrides that end right where you started. Clothes are sort of  the same, characters never stay in the clothes I put them in. I guess Trevor just doesn't like his pink ♥♥♥♥♥cat tank top, he refuses to stay in it. :P Though clothes never disappear from your wardrobe, you have to go back to your house and change again. I'd rather characters not change out of what I put them in when Iam playing as another character. It's 40 degrees C and hot here, so I like putting them in shorts and tank tops and hate seeing them in fleecy hoodies and trousers. I know characters changing out of clothes into something else is probably to make them seem more alive, or to do with console limitations, but don't like it.I really hate trying to fly a plane and a helicopter is almost inpossible to control. Just so glad they added the ability to skip if you keep failing, I hate flying so much so deliberately crash so I can skip as soon as possible. So looks like I wont be bothering to get 100% gold in missions as there are quite a few missions where you must fly a plane or chopper and trying to fly is not worth the frustration.The flight controls are absolutely terrible, extremely sensitive and difficult. They need to have better controls or get rid of planes as Iam playing on PC and don't wish to use a controller. If I wanted to use a controller I'd be playing on console instead.Safehouses aren't really safe and are almost pointless, as cops will follow you in and keep shooting you and kill you. All safehouses are for are saving to advance time, changing clothes and maybe saving your car if you're lucky, as cars I've saved even when leaving them there are not there next time I load. I preferred how it was before, that safehouses were a way to safely escape cops. A true safehaven, as when you'd enter them you would lose all stars and the police would stop chasing you and go away. Now they should just be called a changing room and not safehouse.Cops are pretty much psychic and able to find you very easily. Which is annoying and takes away a lot of the fun.GTA V doesn't seem as fun as previous GTA's, it seems way more serious in the fact that I can't just muck around shooting car tyres and trying to blow up cars as it's too hard and time consuming trying to escape cops as safe houses are crap and not safe. Can't car surf anymore as characters die too easily.Seems like the game is nannying me into just playing the story.Don't seem to make much money, but doesn't matter since there isn't much to spend it on anyway as there is no point upgrading cars.Didn't feel that attached to the characters like I did with other GTA's maybe because Iam not just focused on one. I also did not like any of the characters much. Franklin seems so whiny and immature, Michael is just a fat, unhappy middle aged bastard and even though Trevor is a drug addicted psychopath, I found him the most interesting despite his violent, erratic, nasty behaviour which I guess is because of him being an addict.It's crazy that on metacritic the various professional press reviewers gave combined of 96, which I don't agree with. The game is quite good, but not that good, so they probably don't play the game long enough or Rockstar pays them to say it's good. The user  score or more like proper gamers that play the game for a lengthy amount of time is more acurate in the score of 7.9. I'd rate the game around a 7 or 8 at the absolute most. Even with the things I dislike,Overall it's a mostly fun enjoyable game if you stick to just playing the story. I highly recommend it. And just playing story mode you get at least 80 hours or more of gameplay. And GTA 5 is still worth getting if you just want to play singleplayer story mode and have no interest in online.",1.0

I was annoyed enough about purchasable in-game currency.

"It's a great GTA game, I've been playing the series off and on for years and got really depressed when I learned that my system was ""too good"" to handle GTA4 and the earlier games. i7 920 and an Evga GTX770FTW 4GB card and even Liberty City stories runs in the lowest resolution with the least amount of graphics and still stutters at up to 22fps. Tried patches, tried fixes, but it refuses to run properly - I have the DVD version, not sure I want to risk buying the Steam version and hoping it will work...maybe when they're on sale.GTA5 is pretty incredible and offers a fairly large plot of land to do whatever you really want to do. Sometimes you are forced into story line mode but there is plenty of free-range roaming to do. Buildings are almost all closed off which sucks, you do have the ability to switch back and forth between three characters these days but I've noticed that sometimes your favorite car disappears from a garage you bought, or you switch to a character who just decided to start a massive gunfight the second you decided to take over. Or for fans of Harbinger, ""assuming control""Sadly, it feels like a console port...I wish companies would remember that PCs have better power and more control options - games optimized for consoles run a tad weak on PCs - I don't want to start fooling around with mods before I finish the game but I'm pretty sure there will be a few added later on. Large city, loads of vehicles, houses, businesses to buy, a lot of roads, good graphicsBUT there seems to be a lot of little things that made GTA so wild that are missing. I spent several hours searching back alleys and random trails thinking I'd find some kind of collectible or statue or bag of dope but so far nothing. Not sure if it's something unlockable or if they just decided not to play the 'hide n go seek' that made Vice City so interesting. It's still a great game though, don't get me wrong - it's always fun to load a ton of your own music into radio mode, borrow a nice car and go for a long joy ride, or high speed chase, or engage in a massive shootout - but it needs better ramps at the airport like earlier games had, also needs a five star response team. no tanks and no military showing up?!?I wanted to like it more and I really do like this game, but, it really feels like a simple console port so I have to go with a 7 out of 10 here. There are mods available so there is a good chance at improving things that are missing and adding new content, I haven't tried online multiplayer modes but there's a fair amount of updates that keep popping up from time to time.

"I didn't want to do this, but Rockstar has forced my hand. I'm one of the many players that have had legitimate money taken in the recent sweep, $1,671,220 to be exact. Granted, I only had $2.3M before that was taken, but that was money I had earned myself. I've only encountered one mod user in all my time because I spent half of it by myself in invite-only. I've never had modded money dropped or injected into my account. My stats are public. Everything I've earned, I've earned through time invested into the game.I opened a support ticket about this and the next day it was moved to Cheat/Exploit Report or Banning Issue. It was closed after I was given the standard copy/paste response everyone else is getting: ""Your shared bank account in GTA Online was adjusted to remove illegitimately gained in-game money."" I was put in the cheater pool just like that, even after I've done everything in my power to avoid mod users. I opened a second one, but I don't expect anything.

"GTA 5 is a bit of a conundrum for me, because I can't really review the whole thing as one game. GTA 5's campaign and GTA online are two very different things, and deserve two completely different reviews (I also want to note, I've also played this on PS3 pretty much since it came out, and have played WAY too many hours on it on console).First off is GTA 5's single player campaign, which is, in my opinion, really REALLY good. There's not much more to say other than that the characters are all pretty damn fun to play as. The game is just good, and the attention to detail is surprising in some areas. You wouldn't think that a group developing a sandbox crime heist em up would spend too much time on the little things like golf or tennis, but both of them play really well. The golf in particular probably plays better than some games that are completely dedicated exclusively to golf. From GTA 4, the driving, shooting and melee attacks are all vastly improved aswell.Now the tumorous, microtransaction riddled elephant in the room, GTA Online. Simply put, it's a massive grind. Apartments that you can set up heists from are so expensive you won't be buying one for a pretty long time. New cars are similarly overpriced (the newest super car in the game costs 2 million). Vehicle modifications such as armor, engine tune ups, suspension, and so on are many times more expensive than they are in single player, and completely uncustomizable vehicles like planes, helicopters and boats tend to cost even more than apartments do (because logic I guess). All of this seems to have been done solely for the purpose of selling Shark Cards, Rockstar's overpriced means of aquiring money with no effort. You can buy these cards at prices ranging from 2.99 (which I believe only gets you a  hundred thousand, not enough to buy and upgrade 1 single gun with full ammo) to 99.99 (which gives you 8 million). Looking back at their newest super car at 2 million, that means that if you want to avoid the grind, it will cost you around 50 real life dollars of REAL MONEY, to fully upgrade a fake car that only exists in a video game, leaving you with just a little spending money. Even more ludicrous are the new yachts, which act as big floating player homes in the ocean. These start just shy of 5 million. To put it plainly, according to Rockstar, they seem to think that a fake yacht in a game is worth roughly 60 to 70 dollars in real life money. This is more than the retail price of GTA itself, and is just aweful.To sum up this half rant/half praise of a review, it almost seems as though GTA 5 was designed and developed by a group of dedicated professional game developers, who cared about what they were doing and wanted to make a genuinely good game, and they did just that. The game that is GTA 5 is still a very good game, and the campaign has a fair bit of replayability to it. The city of Los Santos is colorful and fun, and even out in the country side, there's an astonishing amount of detail. However, it's like this team of good game designers were just sort of set aside when it came to GTA Online, at which point Rockstar decided to have a group of accountants design just about everything. Everything about GTA Online exists to make money, from the painful grind to the overpriced useless tat. It's really a shame because once you've played the heists (which reward you with almost nothing but more cars, boats, planes, etc. to buy) there's no more reason to play the game. If you just like pvp combat there are better games out there dedicated solely to pvp. If you just like to race fast cars there's better experiences to be had. It's because of GTA Online that I can't reccomend buying GTA 5 all together, especially when Rockstar seems determined not to focus any effort on any new single player content. This is all coming from someone who has been playing GTA 5 since release, and it's sad to see this happen to a game that so many had high hopes for.",1.0
THEY BANNED ME FOR NO REASON BAD GAME,0.0
"TL;DR Review:GG Rockstar, GG.Longer Review:While I did enjoy GTA, I believe it makes a great example for how flawed the Steam review system is, this game is not bad enough for me to ""dislike"" but in no way good enough to recommend.Both Single Player and Multi Player boast with a huge world filled with different activities for you to explore. And, especially in GTA: Online, you will find races, missions and of course the heists scattered around the map. Yet, somehow the world manages to still feel empty to me, when playing a game called ""Grand Theft Auto"" the last thing I want is all the deathmatch nonsense I find around the map, most missions are too simple to be truly as good as the single player, and thus they bleak in comparison. The races can be fun when they are made by the community or if they generally include crazy jumps and stunts. But most races (especially air races) will end up being won by the person that started first.So? What can you do in GTA: Online? The answer is simple, not much, while I had a lot of fun with a few of the races, I spent mos of my time buying clothes, modding my cars, getting tattoos and of course, doing the much anticipated Heists. That was the most fun part of the MP as they had some form of ""story"" coming with some well made cutscenes and good dialogue (if you can call it that) that made them compelling. And, even the actual gameplay, the killing, driving, flying, etc. worked well in that context. It was fun, or it would have been, but I'll come to the negatives later.OK, we talked about the MP, how was the SP though? Fun, honestly, even though I had basically no choice when it comes to customizing the characters, Michael, Trevor and Franklin, it didn't make the mistakes Online did, providing the player with a lot of fun main and side missions, the story wasn't too cliche even though a lot of the gameplay seemed like it was intended as a tutorial for the MP. Last, but not least, the world (SP and MP), was beautiful, the landscapes, the night sky, all of it was breathtaking. So much in fact that I once went to the beach just for the sake of swimming.So, until now it seems like a fine game, why the thumb down? GTA has problems, major problems, despite being originally released two years ago. First off, the lack of content, I already touched on that before, but again I have to say that most of the stuff you can do is kinda boring, and in both SP and MP heist set up missions are basically mundane tasks.Speaking of heists, you remember when they said that the player could choose how to proceed? Yup, totes true, in SP. And, let's not forget that the choices are ALWAYS binary. Seriously, the Heists could be fun if you didn't have to replay every setup mission 1000x because of either bad teammates, connection or some other silly thing that has nothing to do with the actual game. Also, the stock market is a terrible feature that is tied to missions and will essentially only be of any benefit when in that context.What else? Well the progression system is quite bad. I'm rank 20 something and I'm almost done with everything I want to do in that game, too bad one of those things is to get a minigun (a fun weapon I have to admit) that I can only get when I'm LVL 120. Yup, have fun doing only races for three months do achieve that. But the worst part is the car mod progression, of which some is not tied to rank. As I mentioned, I like tuning cars, well, you HAVE to do races for that. Again, have fun with that if you don't like racing.But the greatest of all problems are still the bugs, performance, connectivity issues and more, oh you finally found a session? Whoops, to bad, we lost connection. People unable to get into cars because of sudden lag, people ONLY starting to lag when in cars with other, crashing, that one guy that is level 12000 and thus has four times more life than me (great game mechanic) that is in the same session. Why? Why don't they just have a server browser? And, of course the most recent bug I have experienced, and also the most recent one, in fact it's the reason that I'm writing this review (bias much?), is the one that locked me outside my account. Yup, can't login. GG Rockstar, well played.To conclude:Pros:+GREAT world and graphics.+Fun even if a little dull Single Player in general.+Good dialogue and filmography when they actually show it off.+Tuning is alot of fun.+Gameplay is overall solid.Cons:-Lack of content, what IS there is dull.-Bugs, crashes, glitches, etc-Problematic progression system.(still somewhat rewarding to get new stuff)-Overall the high expectations were not met.A great game that is sadly dragged down by a few bad design choices and it's bad bad state. Best treated like an early access game, get it once they have actually worked on it. Fun, but not good.Edit(Stuff I forgot, etc): 1) Turns out you can invest in the stock market and make a profit by robbing someone and investing in that stores competitors. Only works in SP.2) You do not make enough money in MP. Heists are the only thing that make a lot of money. It still only allows for very little considering the work you put into them.3)Game crashes when accessing the GTA:V  creator from Online.",0.0

"Played the game for 3 hours total, drove around and checked out the world. Decided to spend 10 dollars to get a shark card for in game currency , played with the tattoo system and got an apartment.  Ended up getting a 30 day unapealable ban for simply playing the game? Contacted customer support and only receieved canned responses regarding the issue,  support refused to refund my 10 dollars  or escalate my call to someone who possibly could.  This is all on top of the fact that the man helping me didn't know how to use the mute function on his phone so I could hear them talking in the back ground and laughing over the issue and saying how the call had lasted 10 minutes over quota for a simple ""ban call"".  Absolutely unbelievably poor customer support. The guy who looked into my account literally said ""you did nothing at all that I can see to warrant a ban"". Bad company. ",0.0

"DO NOT BUY Red Dead Redemption 2.I love this game, but ♥♥♥♥ the people who made it.The online experience for this game could literally be one of the best of all time, but because of the aggressively stupid decisions of certain people, it's turned into a patience exercise.  Issues that could have been fixed years ago, persist.  Issues that should have never been issues in the first place.I'm not even talking about the incredibly long, grindy nature of adding things to your account.I could tolerate triple the prices on many of the items in this game, if I didn't spend so much wasted time loading in and out of various instances that amount to ♥♥♥♥ing nothing.  You can literally spend several hours accomplishing nothing, through no fault of your own, because of the stupid design of the online components.Why the FUC.K, do I have to load into another person's game, before it tells me the game is full, and then bounces me back through another loading screen, just to get back to the spot I was at before?Why the FUC.K, do I have to load into another person's game, before it asks me about aiming solutions of the person's game, and why the ♥♥♥♥ do I have to acknowledge, EVERY TIME, that, yes, despite the fact that they use auto aim, I'm desperate to actually accomplish something, so I will take literally any open instance that's available?  Why do I have to confirm this EVERY FUC.KING TIME, and by the time I confirm it, the session is full?Why do I have to go through some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t arbitrary invitation process, instead of just having some universal heist queue?Why the FUC.K am I constantly matched with players from across the world, who don't speak the same language, who have ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pings, and cheat?

This a a good base game with great grapics but the servers are toasters that are slow and unstable. The online servers are also riddled with hackers as a result of one of the many hackers that i have encounter i have lost on average 800000 dollars in ammo in guns and other items.

"Honestly one of my favorite games to date. I only have 160ish hours on steam currently but I have played since the game was released on Xbox 360. And I have been in love ever since. If you enjoy Singleplayer, or Multiplayer you can have fun on this game due to the endless modding and storyline in Singleplayer, or even the long lasting Multiplayer free roam experience. I won't lie though Online tends to be full of modders these days so expect to run into them. And in order to purchase cars, or housing online you will have to do tons of grinding. But if you're able to look passed those two things then I would highly recommend Grand Theft Auto V.",1.0

"After much delay for the PC release, this game has to be one of the best out of the GTA series without any major hiccups like previous GTA releases. Personally, single player mode need some TLC and I mean such cases as dlcs etc where GTA Online has to offer at the moment. Although GTA Online mode is enjoyable, it's only enjoyable if you're playing with a group of mates. If you play alone, be prepared to get randomly attacked out of the blue where you're up against players who are ranked 10x higher than you, which leaves the online environment unbalanced and not wanting to paticipate much. Other than that, great game and many things to do while free roaming.",1.0

"The gunfighting is horrendous, the driving has always been terrible that instead of fixing it at the source(the gameplay) they just added a feature to be able to flip the car if you mess around with the joystick and try to find 'the sweet spot' like it's a lockpick minigame or something, and the online is made so that if you want to even get anyways, you either need to waste SO MUCH TIME or just give them money, but $3 or $5 will not do!  If you want ANYTHING good you gotta spend 1.5x the amount you could spend on buying the game at launch.  And oh, did you not spend money buying all the things you can do online now?  Well if you didn't know you could still buy stuff(or rather buy shark cards), the game will ♥♥♥♥ing call your phone in GTAV online over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again until you buy them!  What's that?  Did you use the self radio?  Prepare for ""funny"" breaks inbetween your custom songs when they rag on you for playing your own songs instead of listening to their soundtrack!Though I hope you brought your friends if you want to play online, because they'll constantly recommend 2 player minimum missions to the point you'll do ANY 1 player mission even if it's the only one recommended because it's HARD AS BALLS.Also for you few that use DS3/SCP Server controller support for PS3/PS4 controllers, it has great controller support all until the point where the controller disconnects for a second, forcing you to either use keyboard and mouse or quit the game to restart so you can use your controller in game again!",1.0

I played GTA 5 on the xbox when it came out and really enjoyed the single player campaign. So if you have not played that I can recommend it. Multiplayer though.....ugh. Maybe becasue I have come into it late on my PC but I seem to spend most of the time looking at loading screens. And finding anyone to play with on the low level courses is impossible! And then the crashes....so many crashes.If you can find a friend to play with though the crazy new race tracks can be lots of fun!,1.0

"Long and constant loading screen with loads of cheaters. Literally every session has at least one cheater, and they can do pretty much anything they want. Spawn fire under everyone? No problem, they can do that. Spawn money under everyone? They can do that too. Do whatever they want? Oh yes.The shark cash card is a almost like a scam. Every session has a cheater in it, and there's a good chance they're spamming money at you even if oyu don't ask or want it. So instead of buying money, just ask or wait for one of those cheaters to throw money at you. Rockstar doesn't seem to care about it.I really don't recommend you buy this game. If you really want it, wait for a really good sale, and even then you might want to skip the game. The singleplayer is boring and multiplayer is full of cheaters who can do whatever they want, and Rockstar isn't even trying to ban them.You won't believe how much control the cheaters have over the servers, unless you see it.

"So at first R* fails to protect honestly players.And to complete the absurdityThe honest player is that banned most of the time.As I have seen in many cases, banishment is without reason!R* is arbitrary and does not respect the rights of players.You can only report individual hackers and not a hacked session. Most of the time you won't know who is hacking the session. And be warned, this GTA online hacking problem is not over exaggerated. It is unbelievably rampant. It's literally in nearly all sessions. Wanna do the new CEO, Biker, VIP (...) missions, prepare to have a modder take control of your vehicle and kill you, making a lot hours of work in my jobs all times for nothing!!!!It will be some strategy as a trap to make the player be banned and this to buy the game again! I believe so!!I also went through this humiliation. In a year dlc of 2015 where the yatch was launched for purchase. I did not have enough money to buy Yatch.So to complete the amount I sold a few cars from my garage and the next day I got banned. This happened near Christmas.On Christmas 2016 without any reason I was banned again!Is it any kind of automatic banning schedule of the famous R * banwave !!!!!!I have a lot of friends in the game.I thought a lot about buying GTA5 again.But my conscience tells me not to compromise with something I think is wrong.The R * manages the game just so she can take advantage $$.He never thinks of the players, who plays honestly then just gets nervous.Friends I really like you very much but honestly I will not play any more GTA V.

"Good Game, Terrible CompanyGTA V is a truly mixed bag of a game, with genera defining open world design, amazing visuals and decent size of content mixed with an awkward UI, terrible session management, miserable load times and a company who does not care about its customers.The Campaign/Single Player features an excellent story with 3 main characters each with a distinct mindset. Several other side-characters make the game an interesting, lovable world that is a bit surreal in its own but it is fun to play. In terms of depth, for an action game it is well equipped with content with numerous side missions, challenges, weapons, businesses (stock market) and more.However most players will purchase this title for the Multiplayer experience. This is where the game lacks most of its charm, as multiplayer is heavily handicapped with numerous issuesAwkward UI design where even simple actions are hard to achieve like Starting a Mission or setting up a business. You must go through several menus to execute the action you want. Unfortunate legacy of console port design.Terrible Session management. No server browser or easy chance of private play. Whenever a mission is started from a Private Session it will somehow end it up in a Public one. Party members will be scattered around several sessions for no reason. It is insanely hard to host a not-so-popular game mode, since no one will join, and there is no way for you to check if there is active play going on. No dedicated servers available of course. Miserable Load times. Game will sometimes load forever for no reason with only just entering an interior or loading a mission. I would highly discourage anyone purchasing a game without an SSD, and even with that prepare for horrendous load times.  Cheaters and Hackers. Nearly every public match has a cheater, either killing everyone on the map instantly with explosions or giving you money without your consent (for which you can be banned). It is insanely infuriating how incompetent Rockstar is on detecting cheaters.Grinding. Though there is a lot of content offered in multiplayer, for you to buy a Business or become a CEO of a company you need huge amount of cash. The only way to legally get this money is to grind endlessly, make Heists runs with your friends endlessly. Special vehicles, apartments cost absurdly high money, business will need upgrade thus forcing you to buy Shark Cards which give you in game cash for real money, as you will not receive enough money with just grinding.No real co-op experience. Even though you can set up a Bike Club or a Company CO, there is no Party management involved. No asset sharing, or the feeling of building/accomplishing something together. Players not able to invest each other businesses.Hostile Public Sessions. If it’s not cheaters, the player base itself is highly dominated with casual toxic individuals that openly kill anyone on sight without actual threat and ruin any fun you would remotely had in the Public Session game modes. With the above in mind we have arrived the biggest issue of the game and that is Rockstar itself. In the past several months they have shown their commitment to continue not giving a s-h-i-t about their customers. First their inability to do anything about the massive number of cheaters and their banning wave of legitimate non-hackers, their non-existent support, trying to ban Open IV (the modding platform/community for GTAV) and most recently, blatantly stealing money from legitimate users who paid with real money…It is absolutely infuriating to see a game go to hell by the developer like this instead with a little care and fix it would be an excellent game of the decade contester.I genuinely had fun times with my friends and I could recommend this game mainly for the Campaign, and some private play with your friends in Multiplayer. However, I cannot recommend a game with all my heart where a company gives zero faks, robs you and refuse to communicate. This type of mentality and the presence of pay to win Shark Cards raises a great concern about Rockstar’s future titles. GTA V is not a bad game, it is a badly managed game. That could have been the best game ever, but it is left to rot in a cesspool without any bright future ahead. I cannot recommend it at this state. 4/10 Dissapointing ",1.0

There is so much to do and vast amounts of content that make this game truly a masterpiece...almost.The story is in my opinion the weaker of the two. I tried grinding out the story missions in this game only to complete but i stopped because it was no fun to me. The missions are quite bland, the story a little poor and uninteresting. Great voice actors though but not enough depth or characted development imo.

And with singleplayer modding back, I can enjoy it even more. OUTDATED REVIEW:The only reason I have been able to enjoy Grand Theft Auto V for the past 2 years was solely because of singleplayer mods.  This decision shows just how ignorant Take Two Interactive is when it comes to their community.  Not only is this a gigantic slap in the face to loyal GTA fans like me, who've stood by Grand Theft Auto installments since the beginning, but this is a gigantic slap in the face to ANYONE who wants to experience the wonderful things the very talented and creative community has to offer.  This completely excludes Multiplayer Modding, which has been openly shunned and hated by the modding community.  There have been tons of very amazing mods that people have made; porting maps to other games for example, making standalone expansions, things like mission creators, being able to play as a Police Officer legitimately, RPG mods, a co-operative campaign mod, a 2 player splitscreen mod, etc.",1.0
Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V). This is by far one of my favorite games ever. The graphics are great. The gameplay is simple and satisfying. The characters are loveable. There is Franklin a gangster who wants to be a little bit more. Michelle a retired criminal who is basically dying from boredom and my favorite Trevor... just plain crazy Canadian. He is not sorry. Anyway the reason I like this game so much is because there are tons to do even taking away the online mode which I will get to shortly. There is the main story that is interesting and fun where you get to plan your own heist to an extent hire crew members (using the same people in your team makes them get better the more you use them) The fun thing is unlike other GTA games to date (as far as I know) GTA V gives you the option of playing as 3 different characters instead of just one. Each one has a special skill which is pretty cool. There are tons of side characters that are either very annoying (Michelle's family) or very awesome there are even stranger missions that you can do where you meet someone and they ask you to do something for them like a mini story something I really appreciated. All in all I really think this has been one of the best GTA games.Now for the online version. GTA Online aka loading simulator. Don't get me wrong it is worth the wait it is just very annoying. GTAO is very fun especially when played with friends. There are more things to do then I care to mention my favorite are the stunt races. You can get a few friends together and do a heist which is a lot of fun unless you get a random and that person doesn't want to follow the rest of the team. The thing that really makes GTAO feel real for me is you start with nothing just the clothes on your back and by doing stuff like events or heists or even missions you get money which you use to buy houses businesses cars whatever you want. There are even some of the mini games you can play from the single player mode. The community are about what you could expect from GTA in other words most times it is just a bunch of people killing each other. Still fun but can get annoying if you want to do like a car drop where the more damage the car takes the less money you get.Basically if you liked the previous GTA titles you will most likely like this one too. It improved a lot on the GTA formula. Heck there is even a first person mode that seems better then most FPS games out there so well done Rockstar. There is literally something for everyone in this game. Race CTF team death match. There are tons of stuff to do. I recommend picking it up on a sale since it is a little pricey but even at full price it is totally worth the money,1.0

"Basically, Rock Star hates you and only cares about your money. That was obvious from the day it first released, and the fact that it still cost a full $60, despite coming over a year later than the console versions. The screwing-over didn't stop there, though. They started charging ridiculous amounts of money for in game currency. Instead of discounting their game during Steam sales, they would only sell ""discounted"" bundles that included this in-game currency... but which still cost at least $60. When this currency apparently wasn't selling well enough, they started adding a constant stream of crazily over-priced in-game items. It used to be that there were only a couple things you could get for over a million, but now they're a dime  a dozen.And all of these complaints are only valid when the game actually works. GTA V decided to buck the trend of other AAA games; instead of improving over time, it actually gets worse! Now, It can take me up to thirty minutes just to get into an online game and stay in it. And recently, hackers managed to somehow take all of my ammo; rebuying it would cost over a hundred thousand in game dollars, which would conservatively take about an hour to earn back.Finally, they're recently started screwing over creators of single-player mods, which is hard to believe is anything other than an attempt to make even more money with some other upcoming monetization scheme.",0.0
"Truly one of the greatest games of all time.Splendid story mode with hundreds of potential game time combined with the sublime GTA: Online.Lots of free content constantly being added to the online part of the game, with no additional cost.The game is still worth sticker price even after all these years, it is the best Grand Theft Auto game basing by content alone.Heists are great and are fun to farm, constant new interesting game modes are being added pretty much all the time alongside special new vehicles and weapons.You can't give this a bad review even if you're♥♥♥♥♥♥at online and too lazy to acquire the money.

"GTA Online was fun and playable when first released, playing missions with friends and making decent cash. Now to buy anything to actually play the content in Online, you have to grind your way through countless hours of grinding, or pay for shark cards and throw your money at Rockstar.Now they have gone and destroyed the modding community that has helped keep this game relevant.Congratulations Rockstar on breaking the last straw and ruining a good game through greed.TL:DR Grind hours for cash or pay real cash to instantly aquire anything",1.0

"GTA V: a game that would be amazing... if it wasn't so plagued by it's own community.Speaking strictly in terms of online multiplayer, the game is infected. A solid 2 out of every 3 sessions has a miserable kid with a mod menu, endlessly spawning NPCs, fire, explosions, and other annoying entities on the players. And of course Rockstar introduced online challenges-- mini games which pit the players head-to-head to win a cash reward. Naturally, if you're close to winning, you'll be any modder's main target. This awful infestation of cheaters has made the game outright frustrating to play with others, something that GTA is meant to be about.Despite the unfortunate multiplayer environment, the game remains very solid in private sessions and singleplayer game modes. More unfortunately, however, is the fact that public multiplayer is the game mode most people want to play-- therefore I can't recommend this game in it's current, toxic state.",0.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action adventure game developed by Rockstar North. This game is the fifteenth in the series. The game was originally released on Xbox 360 and PS3 in mid-2013, and then got a remastered version on Xbox One and PS4 in late 2014, before finally being released on the PC in April 2015. The game quite rightly is a record setter, selling over 11 million copies and grossing over $800 million on the release day, before breaking the $1 billion marker three days afterwards. GTA V continues in tradition with the type of game play on offer. You play in third person over the shoulder view of the characters. The game has three main protagonists, who each have their own story and plot to go with them – somehow all three of these characters’s path cross throughout the game and they soon become key to each other’s story. The driving in the game has been improved over the previous versions of the game, cars feel even more realistic to drive and the game’s physics engine is almost perfect with figuring out how objects will react should you hit them (or they hit you!). The gun play in this game is significantly better than the previous versions also, I did have issues with aiming and general fight scenes before, but GTA V sets out the controls and feel of the gameplay perfectly allowing you to not run into any stumbling blocks in terms of the controls or mechanics. I did find the flying missions to be quite annoying at times, since I was playing the game on mouse and keyboard, I found the controls to be a bit fumbly when manning a helicopter or plane, but the flying parts of the game are few and far between. The main core of the game revolves around completing story missions for each of the three main characters; these can range from stealing cars for a billionaire’s collection, right the way to robbing banks. There is plenty of variety in the missions you can do, and you will find it very difficult to find a moment in this game where you are bored. The game has gorgeous graphics, no they aren’t photo realistic, but that’s because the game’s style isn’t aiming for that. The PC version of this game is most certainly the pinnacle of gaming; it just puts the console’s version to shame when you compare the two. My rig which is a monster, couldn’t handle putting the game out at 60 fps at 4k resolutions, but was quite happy to run every setting at maximum on 1080p, and it just looks fantastic. Normally open world games try to reduce the graphics slightly just because how much is being loaded at any one time, but GTA V does none of that; each of the textures are all high res, animation is absolutely perfect, and the lighting effects are some of the best I have seen in any video game. As with all GTA games, you are going to get a blockbuster style story line, this is one of the best, if not THE best plot to any video game and one which I will remember. All three of the character’s story are so well written, and perfectly intertwining with each other. The game does have a large amount of cut scenes at the beginning of each level, some people may find this to be annoying as they would rather be playing the story rather than watching it; but personally I found the cut scenes to be just as interesting to watch as it is to play the game. They fully immerse you into the world of Los Santos. Not only is there a captivating main story to the game, there are also plenty of side missions whilst they are all quite basic tasks for you to complete, they all have some sort of story behind them for each character, which are all well worth your time in completing. The sound effects and voice acting goes above and beyond here as well. Every single one of the characters is so perfectly voice acted that you sometimes forget that these aren’t real people in front of. The ambiance sounds of the city are all amazing too, there is never a moment where there is just silence, whether it is people in the street chatting to each other, or someone getting road rage, there is always something going on. Not to mention the game has 162 songs on the radio station, so you will always find something you are in the mood for when you are traveling across the map. The game isn’t exactly hard, there are missions which you will probably have to do over again because of silly reasons, such as crashing your plane from not being able to land it (I have had to do one of the missions way too many times to remember because of this!!), but I don’t think I actually died in a gun fight or a heist of any kind, since most of the time you are with one of the other characters you always have some kind of backup should things turn nasty. Los Santos is one of the biggest game worlds to ever be made, it is bigger than GTA IV, GTA SA and Red Dead Redemption combined. Whilst a good portion of the map is mountain ranges and open fields of emptiness in the northern regions, the actual city is a bustling hive of entertainment and action. Round every corner there is something for you to do, whether it be a side missions that involves you getting your mother the drugs she needs, helping a young lady get her purse back after being robbed (or not?) or just earning an honest day’s work by towing cars that are parked illegally. The world is your oyster in Los Santos.The main story with a good portion of side missions and extras in GTA V took me just about forty six hours to complete. Whilst the main story is complete, I still have plenty of heists, extra missions, stunts, races…so much more to finish! The single player alone in this game can probably hit the heights of eighty hours if you want to complete everything, and it is something I am going to be aiming to do over the course of the next few months. Never have I played a game that has made me want to do that more! Having only played the game through once, I cannot be 100% sure on this, but I feel there is a slight portion of the game which can change depending on what actions you take towards the latter stages of the story so if you do want to replay the game again, there is going to be a bit of a different story at the end of it depending on what you choose. Technically, GTA V is faultless. Many worried that the PC port would be terrible, but they really knocked it out of the park here. The abundance of graphical options, audio options, and options in general, really make this a proper PC game. The game can be played on a gamepad, or a mouse and keyboard. Normally with GTA games I opt for the game pad, but the game is so well optimized for the PC, the mouse and keyboard feel like the only option for me - it just plays so fluidly. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that GTA V is one of, if not the greatest video game out there today. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the game, and it excels in every area in which you will critic a game. The stellar gameplay, exquisite story line, and huge open world for you to explore; it is hard to put this conclusion into words as to how perfect this game is – it is something you really need to be experiencing for yourself as this is a piece of history right here",1.0
"*See Update - 01/01/16*GTA is a well-established IP, so I won't bore you with specifics about the gameplay -- just know that it improves on previous games in many ways. Where GTAV shines is in the solo story mode. The writing is fantastic, the story is engaging, the characters are genuine. Throw in the huge immersive world and a vast diverse soundtrack and you get a very complete solo experience.Things fall apart in multiplayer. Unfortunately the servers are absolutely infested with hackers and there doesn't seem to be much the developers can do to fix it. The only way to enjoy multiplayer is to create an invite-only or friend-only instance and hope you have enough (non-hacking) friends to play with to keep things interesting. *Update 01/01/16* It appears that Rockstar has vastly improved the online experience by cracking down on hackers. Regardless of your stance on modding, one cannot deny the vast improvement to GTA Online after the crackdown. Further, Rockstar continues to very regularly provide additional content for GTA Online. This keeps things fresh and gives you more to work towards. GTA Online is now where I spend most of my time.In closing I would say that while I recommend the game, I would tell anyone who is still on the fence to wait until it's on sale. The game has been out for a while now, so $60 seems too steep unless you're a fan of the series or just have plenty of disposable income.",1.0
Great game but for some reason got banned for 30 days and player reset.   Played the game honestly and this is what you get.

"The 4th was better, but that doesnt mean this one is bad. Its actually great! I bought it on xbox and ive played it alot, thats why i never play it on pc, bc ive already experienced it. Singleplayer is good, somewhat boring in some parts, but good! The multiplayer is... something. Really honestly, playing in private multiplayer games with friends is better than public lobbies. Oh, and NEVER buy shark cards unless you dont have a good car and a nice apartment. This game is literally all about the grind (at least in public matches). This game reminds me of Destiny, except you dont have to pay to unlock the full game. Oh and this game is better than that poor excuse for an fps game.",0.0

"dont buy this, use your hard erned money on someone who cares about its playersthere is a good chanse of you getting banned from online at any moment, no matter if you played 100% legitand when you are banned rockstar politely asks you to F*** off when you try to tell them you did nothing wrongthey just tell you bans are finalGame is good. Sharcards rouinded online.This game online is just a job. all i do is make money and i can never afford anything, i don't even use my amazing minigun in game just because the ammo is to expensive. All i do is save for cars and then i have to spend money on ammo or something and lose all of it before i can buy what i want. if i want something like this i will just go out in the real world and get a real jobb. Much more rewarding. This game is only good for people that are milioneres and can use 5000 on a game. That is because of shark cards. I wold actually be ok with shark cards if you actualy got money enough for the prise your paying for them. The car i want now is several millions and for me to buy a shark card to pay for it would cost me more then i paid for the game. And then a miracle happened. A cheater that gave me money! finaly i could buy a bikers dlc warehouse and finaly make money! But no such luck.after setting it up i neaded to get some supplies i needed to make money off the warehouse, so i went into a a bar on the map with my motorcycle(yes i drove inside the club, because i could not have weapons in there, and i thaught i would be easyer) So after running all of them over with my motorcycle it finaly came up on the screen that i could grab the suplies. but no the had glitched into the floor or some s### and i could not take it. So i went out of the bar and called pegassus to get a plane and fly back to my motorcykle club so i could get some different supplies, but pegasus did not answered so could not get the planes i paid MILLIONS for back when i was a cheater. then a message poped upp. the mesage told me that my staff had be taken by the police and had to save them. So i stole a plane(f### you pegasus) and went to  the club house. i thought that if i died i would be spawed back on the ground and be able to continue fighting. But because i wanted to have FUN i started crashing into the police helicopter  to bring it down. I failed misrably and died. Then when i got respawned i figured out i lost all my produkt! i spent f###ing hours getting to that and then poff gone. So if you like love playing offline this is a great game, i cheated money offline/singleplayer and it is great fun, Online, not so much fun if you are playing legit, and if you are not you wil get banned pretty quick.I think the graphics and such are ok but you nead a good pc to make them look good.But anyway how bad online is i have the game and i am going to continue playing singleplayer as it is quite good",1.0

"I've thoroughly enjoyed GTA (Online) for the past couple of years (three years since PC release). The game offers a variety of gameplays, nice cars (to buy and steal), tuning, races, Missions,...  It's all been alot of fun. But since about a year, the main focus for the creators is to continually and gradually increase profits through sharkcardsales (ingame microtransactions: Simple put: you fork out real cash for fake ingame cash). All prices for every new item ingame have drastically risen and continues to rise. Now you can also earn ingame money and quite a good deal to be honest, but since the last few months it's been very clear that the gaming company wants to maximize your moneyloss. One might say this is the essence of this game (putting people up against people) and that might be true to an extent. But when you have to collect items for quite a few hours and then , during the few minutes of a sale, it gets blown up in a matter of secs by other players, the fun will wear off soon. In current GTA-online, things are all tweaked to maximize your loss (military vehicles/futurustic vehicles,..). This coupled with great new vehicles (including those military vehicles and now new planes) and their huge pricetag will push players towards microtransactions.Some players decided to 'grind' certain ingame money makers, but since the last two DLCs, it became apparent the ingame money monitoring software was/is buggy. This 'bot' removes illegitimate earned money (due the game being massively hacked the last six months) and while that's a good thing, it also started removing legit and honest earned ingame money from players. Ofcourse you'll always have people crying out innocence, when they're not, but the magnitude and outrage of players crying out right now, speaks otherwise. So then you start filing a formal complaint, aka ticket, to the gaming company to check the 'bot's possible failures... To cut a long story short. There is no support,  you will receive a formal confirmation the removal was correct and due to illegitimately acquired ingame money. No explanation on the when and where and why, so you can at least verify and possibly adapt your gaming. No, if you persist in sending in tickets, the tone of the automated replies turns grim while threatening you with a possible ban if you persist in breaking the EULA. So instead of an explanation (which is the very least a player deserves when he got robbed of ingame m illions (which do mean quite a few hours of ingame work), you get served a threat. Currently alot of longtime players are re-evaluating their gaming time within GTA-online. It's still a fantastic game, but once you'll get hit by something that appears fundamentally incorrect wrt ingame earning (= hours of playing the game), you cannot trust the game that it won't happen in the future again, as you'll receive ZERO explanation.I'm not gonna recommend this game to new players. The ingame money earning has decreased drastically, the ingame price tages increased exponentially and the ingame monitoring is so focused on eliminating players' money, it can't distinguish illegit from legit money. So both get taken away and then you have to their Support. See above for what happens next...A damn shame, cos there really is no game like this, but it'll come with an ever increasing (real life) pricetag... Just don't assume you can earn it all ingame... You clearly can't... Sad really... Paid DLC would have been a far better choice for players and the gaming company... Not this...",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V (GTAV) (GTA5) is the best Grand Theft Auto installment in the series, others may say other GTA games such as GTA San Andreas or GTA Vice City is the best, that's up for debate. But in terms of Online quality and story, this game excels in both of those catorgories. While some flaws in the Online, such as hackers (Big problem as of now) but if you play with friends, this game is an absolute blast. This game has created a great bonding experience with one of my friends and we still play it a lot today. If you're wondering how the single player is, it's great. Story is awesome but in my opinion, GTA 4's story was a lot better than GTA 5's story but in terms of gameplay, GTA 5 is a massive improvement over GTA 4 by a loooooong shot. There's so much you can do with this game it's not even funny. While the single player mode can get a little boring after you complete the story, Online has tons and tons to do and more to come! This game is an amazing experience and if you haven't bought it yet, you definietly should because this is a top notch game. But there is some thing this game needs improvement on, such as the heisting system because if someone leaves, the whole heist is failed. Or if someone dies, the whole heist is failed, which is very very annoying if you're pubbing, so get some close friends to play this with you and it will be tons of fun. Another thing that GTAV could improve on is removing Rockstar's DRM which is Rockstar Social Club, it's not that great as i would much prefer this game using Steam's servers but hey, atleast Social Club servers aren't awful. Another improvement this game could do is improve the amount of VRAM it uses, yes it uses a lot. But aside from those things, this game is amazing. All and all, this game is a 9/10. Worth every penny.",1.0

The singleplayer story is awesome, as well as adding the ability to play as more than one character, and the ability to choose your own ending.The game is constantly pumping out new and awesome DLCs that keep the online experience fresh and awesome, as well as the main online missions that came with GTA Online when it came out are also awesome, and the apartments and Heists are great.They've also added customisable apartments and ""Stilt Apartments"" (A.K.A Houses) which is pretty cool.Cars are cool and are a main element in the game, the fact that they keep bringing out more and more is really cool and makes races and custom missions really fun.Basically, Grand Theft Auto V is a fun game that most likely won't get old until close to the next installment in the series' release, and if you think you'll want it, I definitley recommend buying it. (Take it from the guy who bought it four times.) Overall Rating: 9.2/10 [Just minor issues like toxic online players that won't stop pestering. Doesn't happen all the time, but still happens.]",1.0

"A must for the saga fans. One of the best games I have ever played. Only thing that I dislike are the loading times in the GTA Online.Totally worth the 2 year wait.10/10Edit December 18th: The new Doomsday heists are amazing. Such a breath of fresh air. Too bad everything is quite expensive (facilities, vehicles) to make you want to buy shark cards, but the heists pay really well and are actually quite fun",1.0
Only ~25 people per server? Usually have to switch session/server 2-3 times before you can get 4 decent people to play a heist. For 1 hour gameplay be prepared to get at least 45min of loadingtime if you are using the best equipment of PC/SSD/100mbit.Bottom line is. Too much loading.,1.0

"I understand wanting to combat hackers that are on GTA Online, and I am all for that, but messing with OpenIV and taking away the ability to mod the game for single player is just plain silly. I believe that most people who do mod the game are not in it to ruin other peoples fun, they mod to enjoy the singleplayer the way they want. I feel this is also on Rockstar too, as they once mentioned before bringing a storymode DLC but they have become money hungry and only release DLC for Online and want you to buy sharkcards. They stopped releasing the new cars for singleplayer in hopes they buy sharkcards online. Shame on both Take Two and Rockstar",1.0

"Let me preface this by saying that GTA V was a great game.However, Take 2 Interactive's recent banning of Open IV, a mod tool for SINGLEPLAYER mods, all in the name of getting rid of multiplayer hackers, is completely ham fisted and idiotic. They have no relation to eachother, and this will not stop the hackers in the multiplayer portion. It might even make it worse. Just look at DRM, especially Denuvo. Supposedly impossible to crack, but is happening all the time. You really think that banning singleplayer mods is going to get rid of multiplayer cheating? If you do, you need to wake up.If you weren't so greedy and wanting everyone to buy sharkcards for multiplayer, this wouldn't be as much of an issue, for anyone. But all you are doing now is hurting yourself. People who are relatively unaffected by this move will still leave the game because of your practices. There will also be a few handfuls of people left who don't own the game, but will want to get it, and all of this BS is going to deter some. I never bought sharkcards, never in a million years ever intended to, and I got the game on a sale, which I wish had been for less, now.Mods don't hurt games, most of the times they greatly improve it, or go into something completely different. Just look at CounterStrike, which was originally a mod for Half-Life. Or Team Fortress, originally a mod for Quake. DotA, a mod for Warcraft 3. Where would these highly successful games be if all devs/publishers shared this dogmatic view of mods? Where would gamers sit if this would be the case? Day one DLC, and pay2win features in full price games. That is where it would be, and is where the market has been sliding for years.",1.0

I have removed my Positive GTA5 Review. Take Two has started to DMCA modding for GTA5. I bought this game on Xbox 360 and PC and of course my PC Version was the future for modding because I love PC Gaming and I think a big part of it is modding and players making something amazing.Rockstar has done nothing for Single Player since release and they keep trying to force us online for their Micro Transactions.No thanks you are now one my first games with a negative review.Screw your dirty tactics on behalf of the OpenIV team.,1.0
"This review is because of Take Two's actions against the modding community. It's not much but it's what's in my power to do. I love this game, and now I don't know if I will play it again. Sad times.",1.0
The multiplayer is a micro-transaction hellhole but until now the singleplayer was a fantastic modding playground. That has changed since Take-Two made modding the game essentially illegal. As a result I would not advise buying it as the experience has dramatically decreased in quality.,1.0
"Let me first put this into perspective: The game itself is extremely good and I would recommend buying this game ON XBOX ONE/360 or PS3/PS4. Do NOT buy the PC port of this game until they do some SERIOUS patching because every single time I tried to play either story mode and GTA Online, the game would cause my PC to crash and go BSOD. I have the latest drivers installed on my PC, my specs are more than enough to run GTA V and yet every time I try to play the game, it crashes and I get a BSOD message. I've tried lowering my graphic settings, running it in windowed mode, using compatability mode, running the game as an administrator, and yet it still crashes and I get the BSOD.I went to Rockstar to see if I could get some help, only to find out that others are experiencing the same thing, they are also having their games crash and lead to a BSOD. ""It's one thing if a game freezes and crashes but it is another thing when the game takes my whole computer down with it! This isn't just a game breaking bug, but a possible computer-breaking one!""This guy, CombatDurable in the Rockstar comments section stated perfectly how I felt because this game is causing my entire system to crash and could possibly end up damaging my PC if I continued, so I had no other choice but to ask for a refund.My honest opinion is that you should hold off on purchasing GTA V for the PC until Rockstar patches all of these issues because there is seriously a problem here if GTA V is causing myself and other people's systems to crash and go BSOD.",1.0

"Pre-TL;DR:  Creator Mode has poor controls, gun play is lack-luster at best, no dedicated servers, no solid mod support.If you're looking for a game with a great PC experience... You're looking in the wrong damn place.  With Rockstar not being open with mods and a simple port over to the PC, I can personally say that this game is not worth $60.What do I mean by a ""simple port""?  First, the Creator for the game, the part that allows users to create custom arenas, courses, and etc for the pre-existing game modes is still based for the controller.  A majority of the controls are forcefully bound to your keyboard, so if you're looking to move a prop just a smidge up... Good luck.  Another thing is the console feeling shooting system.  No recoil. Minimal Spread.  You can say I'm crying, because I am.  I'm crying because someone can rapid fire a semi-auto rifle from a long range and easily land body shots on someone (in this situation, me) who wanted to try and take the extra half a second to aim for the head with the actual bolt action sniper rifle.TL;DR: The Creator is mostly keyboard based, the gun play is lack luster... at best.Now, regarding everything else that's missing from a true PC game... No sign of dedicated servers or any solid mod support.  Why would dedicated servers need to be a thing?  For modded game types, such as different maps other than Los Santos, a roleplay game mode, added weapons and jets, and etc. that could be enjoyed by a fairly large group of people.  The multiplayer is heavily limited to what Rockstar produces for the game.Modding is what makes the PC experience what it is.  It's something that consoles won't be able to do for a long time, if ever.  Rockstar does not seem to be in support of modding the game multiplayer wise, unless you want to be banned or labeled as a hacker.TL;DR:  No dedicated servers, no solid modding support.You can agree with me, disagree with me, but I don't plan on playing the game much anymore unless major changes are made.  So don't worry, you won't have to see my crying in game.",1.0

"Rockstar made this game a wonder for sure. But I cannot identify is how irresponsible the service of Rockstar Support Team  is. I enjoyed the game for nearly 1000h but something just made me feel strange about Rockstar Games. Can Rockstar improve the graphic of the game for both NVIDIA and ATI players? Think more about player's feelings instead of Rockstar's convenience plz. Once IGN gave the game full mark I decided to buy it. Game is good, but Rockstar have to improve its Auto-Anti-Cheating System. And be more responsible, replay to our questions! Don't use the same auto reply to us to escape from the real problems. Everyone knows there is so much things u guys need to do per day, if Rockstar cannot make most of the players feel happy, think about improving your team instead of players behavior.",1.0
"Let me just say first that I've never posted a review of any game as I normally don't induldge in games enough to be able to post a thourough enough review. I purchased this game originally just to get the game. Like a majority of people. Didn't care much for online as I just wanted to get the experience of playing GTA V on PC since it was a different feel and a brand new experience overall. I have not yet completed the single player campaign on PC as I went through it completely on next gen before the PC release. Have tried a time or two but repeating a campaign isn't something I find interest in on any game. With that said I did spend a lot of time exploring the open world and just doing what I wanted to do as I felt. That, too, becomes very old as would be expected when becoming so adjusted to an open world map. When I felt single player wasn't cutting it anymore I attempted to invest time in online. Rockstar does a tremendous job at adding content to this game with all of the game mode additions, vehicle additions, weapons and so on so I am not cutting them short in that respect. Put simply, online also gets boring as time goes on. Heists become very frustrating if you don't have a large group of friends to play them on. Races are a cluster most of the time. Death match game modes are very fun for the first couple of times you play them but become very repetitive as time goes on. Don't even get me started on the open world aspect of online. When you do everything in GTA V it becomes very uninteresting. It is hard to bring yourself to press ""Play"" when you know you'll be running through the same frustrations the last time you tried. With that said, there was one thing that extended my interest in GTA V. Mods. Mods kept me playing this game when I ran out of interest. Mods take up about 40% of the hrs on record that you see posted. Mods are in large part why there is any real interest in this game this late into its life. The single player campaign is fantastic. The online is.. meh. Both run out on you and mods keep a constant interest. Now that's gone and so is what interest I had left in this game. Going to help clear out some hard drive space I must say. :)",1.0

With all the new buildings constantly being added it beings to quickly drain your cash adding up to be almost 2000+ dollars. It sounds small but it adds up really quick. Another issue coming up with it is that things are becoming way too over priced for any average person. A few years ago you could buy the best house and the best car for only 25 real bucks. Now you can buy 100 bucks worth of shark cards and be barely be able to buy anything.Then to top it all off Rockstar recently took millions away in cash not only from be but other players too!

"It was a decent game on launch, but I've only become progressively more disappointed in it since then. The singleplayer is alright, it's the same ""just do whatever"" style fun as I've had in all other GTAs.The online multiplayer is atrocious. It's a huge grind to get a decent level and good toys to play with, or you can buy them with real money.Rockstar has, of course, focused pretty much entirely on the online part of GTA to keep suckers people coming back and buying more things with real money.The singleplayer has gotten no DLC, it's still the same as it was three years ago; the multiplayer has gotten a load of ""free"" DLC that you can grind to get the content of or buy with real money.And be careful what you run in the background of GTA V when playing online or you may be outright banned, and you can't appeal that -- you just have to wait it out. I'm pretty sure anything with an overlay, like discord or a program to show your framerate, will cause a ban. Actually cheat all you want though, everyone does, the system's completely broken and bans legitimate players but leaves rooms full of cheaters.Despite rockstar trying to get rid of them, there are a few mods around that let you play actually *fun* multiplayer, I believe. I haven't tried any of them lately. In fact, I haven't played GTA V in months; that's what prompted me to write this review. I have what should be a really fun game that's just been sitting in my library for months becuase every time I try to play online it's awful and every time I try to mod singleplayer it's difficult because rockstar fights against mods with every update. If the creators aren't maintaining the mods you like for the next update, you can't use them anymore. Even though the updates are never for singleplayer, just multiplayer and breaking mods.Basically, buy it for the singleplayer or don't buy it at all.____Edit, 6/15/2017Actually, strike that last part. Don't buy it at all. Take-Two has actively declared that modding is not to be allowed at all and is threatening legal action against those who disagree. To anyone wondering, yes they have made an official response. Yes the C&D to OpenIV was from them.The modding scene is now even more difficult as official sources for modding tools are being taken down.♥♥♥♥♥tar still hasn't updated the singleplayer in all the years it's been out, it doesn't even have most of the cars from the multiplayer in it. At all. You can't even fly a hydra in singleplayer without mods.And every multiplayer update is more and more expensive to force you into their microtransaction BS. The multiplayer is also terrible even if you buy their microtransactions because, you see, it's not meant to be fun; the multiplayer exists only to earn in-game money at such a slow rate that you'll eventually give up and buy shark cards, only to then realize that everything is pointless and there's nothing fun about it.Did you know there's a mod for SP that lets you shoot cars out of your guns? Another that lets you take over the bodies of random NPCs. I'm quite partial to one with the ability to turn any car you're driving invisible. Pretty fun stuff, I think -- too bad Take-Two disagrees.",0.0

It's a really good game as always rockstar has won hearts of all it's fans. I had thus game on my ps3 when it released then on my ps4 a year later and last year I got it on my laptop. I started GTA online and discovered a whole new world of adventures and thrill. As there may be annoying modders but yet playing alongside my friends gave and still gives me reasons to never stop playing this game.,1.0

"Update June 15, 2017:Take-Two has declared modding illegal. This is a disgrace, and an affront to countless individuals who have put in long unpaid hours to bring new twists to a game they love. With this move by Take-Two, that love is lost, perhaps forever.If they had only taken two seconds to think...----Singleplayer gets a thumbs-up. Rockstar seems to have forgotten about it.Multiplayer is balanced to encourage hackers. Either spend tens (or hundreds) of hours required to just start playing with the dlc's / buy a fancy car / whatnot, spend hundreds of real dollars to buy their macrotransaction shark cards, or find a friendly neighborhood hacker that'll give you that money for free.If you buy it, buy it for the singleplayer. Multiplayer is only fun so long as you don't care about progression.",1.0

"I've had several issues (not technical) with this game in the first place, all of which being over GTA Online.To start off with, I did like the single player (and probably the only reason I have 200+ hours put into the game), fluid story with some very memorable characters, polished gameplay, the whole nine yards.But the amount of lies and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t that became GTA Online was simply astounding, you thought No Man's Sky was bad? Rockstar -promised- that Heists would come with Online either immediately or a short time after. Que a year and a half later and they finally added it into the game. But what flabbergasts me the most is the absolute disregard for the playerbase, GTA Online is not a game or the online counter-part to such, it's a money-making scam mascerading as a game. Everything, literally everything, is made to make you waste hours upon hours of your life to get menial upgrades/vehicles/houses/garages/whatever due to the abhorrent time/reward system Rockstar uses as a template. So naturally they have Shark Cards, which cost real money and are the ♥♥♥♥ing worst cancer on the planet; $100 ACTUAL DOLLARS gets you ONLY 10 MILLION in game currency, which if you haven't been keeping up on the prices for items in GTA, goes by so quick that it's literally worthless, hence why I say this 'game' is a scam, plain and simple.If Rockstar continues to try to ♥♥♥♥ over players who just want to play the game and not waste hours upon hours getting stupid♥♥♥♥♥♥to get what they want, then I do sincerly hope it's the next gaming company to go under, the talent can be used by actual game devs, not greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.",0.0

overall gta is a good game.i suggest it but i have to admit that if you buy it for PC there are enough glitches to ruin the fun but they dont happen to everyone so the risk is low,1.0
"TL:DR Play at your own risk.Story mode (singleplayer) was good. nice story, good length to it, plenty of things to do and do them in your own way.GTA online. Also good, plenty of expansions and looks like plenty more to come. there are a few characters to be aware of, people who've had the game since the start and now to fulfill their boredom will resort to being a pain in your proverbial (putting it nicely). Also not everything is about shooting, i got into the game to have some arcade racing fun again and it sure did deliver.And now for the reasoning for the recommendation and the warning at the start. Got the game about 7 months ago. played say 100 hours in SP before going to MP, giving me almost 600 hours of time in it., which was a few hours a day for most days since christmas. Rockstar do ban people, first for a month and then indefenitely, for things like greifing, modding/hacking, but also it seems for no apparent reason, which is what happened to me at the start of this week. i play legitimently and genuinely have no idea what deserved the ban. the ban would have been hard enough to take if it didnt also include a full wipe of my characters (weapons, money, vehicles, stats).Trying to appeal the ban doesnt work, despite being given the option to, all you would get is a copy-pasted response saying bans are final and cannot be appealled (why give the option then?). Also trying to find out the reason for the ban will get you nowhere.As such im currently not interested in trying to regain my stuff by grinding another 600 hours, and may not pick up the game ever game, which is a shame as i enjoyed playing it.So to reiterate: good game all round, be careful of a few in multiplayer, and play at your own risk in case you get sent back to square one just for turning on your computer.8/8 update: just a quick update. was able to get back in today after a month of unfair banning, and as expected, but hoped not, my entire stuff was gone.I gave up after a week of trying to get reinstated or at least finding out what got me banned, but kept getting stonewalled by the same copy-paste message. i even tried to help rock* a few times by offering to help identify what caused a false positive so that it doesnt happen again to anyone else, but still got the identical message. seriously what sort of support reads the first line of ""THIS IS NOT A BAN APPEAL"" and then shoves it with all the other ban appeals.might try one last time to get things added back in but not hopeful.so to re-reiterate: single player good, only play multiplayer if prepared to lose months or even years of progress due to the whims of a fallible cheat detection system.",1.0
"Mods makes the game acually popular, Microtransactions in multiplayer does not apply to the single player AND TO GET NEW STUFF IS TO USE THE MULTIPLAYER! Games that have modding keeps the game alive! Look at Skyrim and Fallout, they LIVE because of the mods!By banning mods you kill creative people to make good kontent to push your agenda towards earning Trillions and not billions.I am sorry, that you dont like mods, and i am sorry that you are shooting your own foot.",1.0

"The negative reviews are mostly complaints about Online and they do make valid points but if you're considering not buying the game because of the reviews about Online please do know that you can create private sessions to play with friends.The Main Story // Single Player""When a young street hustler, a retired bank robber and a terrifying psychopath find themselves entangled with some of the most frightening and deranged elements of the criminal underworld, the U.S. government and the entertainment industry, they must pull off a series of dangerous heists to survive in a ruthless city in which they can trust nobody, least of all each other.""What the main story has to offer:+ 69 Unique Missions (actually 79 but they used 69 to make the lame 69 reference) which is around 30 - 40 hours of gameplay+ Strangers & Freaks+ Heists+ Many Easter Eggs and References+ Amazingly directed+ Humorous and amusing+ Great voice-acting+ Trevor PhilipsGameplay (Single-Player and Online)The Gameplay has greatly improved from the past games, adding some nice new features but sadly also removing some nice features.+ A beautiful, immersive open world to explore.+ A much less complicated driving system compared to GTA 4's+ Optional First Person View you can use for a whole new experience+ Nice Vehicle Customization+ Great Character Customization+ Realistic character movement+ Great Physics- They completely removed Euphoria - Lack of interior+ A vast range of activities you can do in the game+ Many vehicles and weapons- Lack of fighting styles.+ You can talk to pedestrians and cops (Single-Player)- The missions aren't really that hard- Rude cops- Crappy AI, most of them just walk away or even call the cops on you for standing next to them or staring at them- You can't really shape your Online character+ Strip Club in which you can look at uncensored female nipples+ Cool Transition when you switch characters (Single-Player)+ Plug-and-Play controller support. You can literally plug your controller in and instantly play the game with it.Graphics and Performance+ Great Graphics+ Supports 4K resolution in 60 fps+ I wasn't really expecting my PC to run this game well as it's a next generation game but suprisingly enough, it did.- A few graphical errors- Misleading Minimum Requirements, you need atleast 6 GB of RAM in order to make sure that this game runs smoothlyOnlineOnline is basically the multiplayer mode of GTA V and is also the reason why most people are buying the game though if you're planning to play the game only for its Online mode you should really consider playing Single Player too.+ It's fun messing around with people in free roam+ 4 game modes: Missions, Heists, Versus, Races and Adversary Modes (excluding Freemode events and VIP Work since they're both in free roam)- Repetitive missions+ Adversary Modes has a variety of different PvP modes which are all enjoyable- It's full of Hackers who ruin the game. They strip your weapons, money and kill you. There are some nice hackers out there who give you free money but where's the fun in that?- Online servers occasionally go on maintainence but I'm fine with it.-Long ♥♥♥ loading time compared to Single Player. I usually go to Single Player first and switch to Online after.In ConclusionThe game is a fantastic game but it does not live up to its name. It's called Grand Theft Auto but most missions do not involve stealing cars and there's also a chance of getting a bounty on your head for stealing cars off NPC's Online. I do recommend this game but you're better off buying this game during a sale.Story Mode - 9/10Graphics - 9.5/10Optimization - 10/10Soundtrack - 9/10Gameplay - 8/10Online - 7/10Overall: 8/10",1.0

"Let me split this review into 3 sections. One for the Online mode, One for the Single-player and one for the Modded RP side of things.Online: At first I loved Online and I love Rockstar but they have just riddled this game with micro-transactions and their ""Shark Cards"". Its pretty much just a huge circle that goes as follows; They announce a new DLC that has the new fastest car that everyone wants and adds some kind of gimmicky vehicle that you'll enjoy for 20 minutes then either sell it or let it collect dust in the garage. Next, the brand new fastest car costs a fortune and you can either spend a week to try to get enough money to purchase it or to buy a ""Shark Card"" to instantly get it with your real life, hard earned cash. Then, in a few days or maybe even a week you will get burnt out until they announce another new DLC which is exactly the same as the last one but with a new skin on it. With the brand new fastest car and that new gimmicky vehicle that they have to add. + its riddled with hackers and cheaters.Singleplayer: The singleplayer storyline is FENOMINAL. I can't even describe how great it is when a young poor criminal (Franklin) meets up with an old ex-criminal under witness protection (Micheal) who tries to help the young poor criminal get some ill-gotten cash which then the old ex-criminals partner who is some twisted redneck (Trevor) figures out where he lives to get revenge.Im bad at explaining things but its just great and it is a somewhat lengthy story aswell which is always a plus.Modded RP: The modded RP scene is still in development but so far its great and its all fun. It already has a lot of the functunality of SA:MP (San Andreas Multiplayer) and if not more. It seems very promising and I can't wait to see what it leads to.Overall, You could buy this game for the Single player and/or the modded RP. but Rockstar just can't stop milking their game of micro-transactions and it also doesnt help that the publisher of this game, Take Two, tried to take away pretty much the whole modding scene but thanks to the community, that didn't happen.5.5/10",1.0

"I'm prefacing this by stating that my older brother actually put in most of the time in SP mode only thanks to mods while I've only personally put 20-30 hours. And I'm writing this review from a perspective of someone that games on the go. A lot.This ""review"" isn't really about the game itself but the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices it has more.It's a fun game yes but you have to ask yourself these questions:1. Do you always have an online connection?2. Will you actually want to play the game's multiplayer for a long duration?If you answered no to one of them I wouldn't get it if you haven't already.1. Rockstar social club has an ""offline"" mode... It does... But what the actual flying ♥♥♥♥ is the purpose of having an ""offline"" mode in the R* launcher, not Steam's offline mode if you're STILL gonna need an online connection to ""authenticate"" your purchase pretty much every 1-2 times you turn off and on your computer.Sure you just need to go online on Steam, launch the game online then close it and disconnect your internet then relaunch the game without internet but really? The R* launcher has an actual ""offline"" mode option but it's not even usable.2. Here's my problem. The game itself constantly updates with multiplayer content that I DON'T want. Whether you actually play the multiplayer or if you just want to ♥♥♥♥ around in Single player it doesn't really matter. Still gonna be forced upon yourself to download the GTA:O content. And no I'm not writing this ""review"" on his behalf. I'm just baffled as to how it is objectively better to own a pirated version of this game if you have no intention to play the multiplayer content. You don't need an online connection to play SINGLEPLAYER content, it takes up less disc space. Which wouldn't be a problem if the game was around the -teens size but we're talking about a game that's over 60GBs. So we're talking about potentially 60GBs of useless junk if I were to end up somewhere that doesn't have any internet access for a couple days. Before you GTA:O ♥♥♥♥ go ""GtA V is AbOuT OnLinE noW"" Please ♥♥♥♥ off. I have already hinted that my older brother has personally spent over 200+ hours in singleplayer alone. I myself would spend much more if it meant I could actually play something I rightfully purchased anytime, anywhere I wanted.",1.0

"Overall Game     I have followed GTA 5 for a long time now. I first got the Xbox One version of the game and it was amazing! I got with friends and did tons of missions not realizing that we spent half the day in the game! Then hiests came out, and that made the expierience even more fun. Don't forget aboutr the story mode too. I mainly play the Online mode but I always found myself playing this amazing story mode! I would definently recommend that you try a few missions of the story mode to get a feel for the world of Los Santos! But enough of how I think of the game, let's get into how the game plays.                                                                            How it Runs     If you are worried about how the game runs, don't be. This game runs completely fine for me, but that might just be because I have a decent to high-end computer (GTX 970 NON OC, 16gb of RAM, i5 6600k NON OC, Windows 8.1 64bit, and this IS running on a Mechanical hard drive).This game does not require to run on a SSD, but if you have enough space, you might as well to make sure you are getting the best performance. Everybody say the loading screens are horrible, but they run completely fine for me. It's not extremely fast like some games though. You can always mix and match what your graphics settings are to get the performance If you want me look at your computers specs to see if you can run it, just send me a message.                                                                       Game Mechanics     I was a bit skeptical about the driving on a keyboard, but it turns out that the driving was actually really fun in my opinion. Just in case, though, you should have a controller plugged in just so you can switch between them. On the other  hand, I'm not a big fan of the flying with a keyboard, I would definently recommend a controller for flying. On foot, this game plays amazing in gun fights. It all comes down to your opinion on how you want to play the game though. If you don't like the controls for the keyboard, experiment! You can fully customize what your controls are from on foot or in a air craft!

"I got this game back on the 360 in 2013 when it came out,  and I had hours dedicated to Online.  After the Ill-Gotten Gains content was released on the 360 I stopped playing it for the exact same reason of recent events. Unexplained bans.  I had a two level 100+ characters on the 360 version with around 3 mil on both accounts.  But one day I got banned for no reason.  Coming back to GTA Online now, nothing much has changed,  but just a lot of content Ive missed out on. Reading reviews on how innocent players who dedicated hundreds,  or thousands of hours in Online just to see that progress crumble down, it's unfortunate. This game is fun but it has its downsides.  Quite a lot more than asked.  My only real problem is on stunt races. Quite a handful of them,  it freezes.  Other than that.  Its a mixed game.  If there was a mixed option instead of a Yes or No for recommendation.  I'd put it under mixed .",1.0
"Banned for doing absolutely nothing. Great game in theory but the company running it is sadly complete and utter garbage, their automatic cheat detection the worst in history and their support mockingly bad.If you plan to play this game online know that even if you keep your game entirely vanilla and don't use any exploits, heck even if you play private sessions only, you might get banned anyhow. It's going to be a gamble for even the most legit players.",0.0
"This Game Has Been Out For 3 Years and is still a very enjoyable game. The Constant amount of DLC being added to Online just makes this game so much fun.

"The notorious series everyone knows and has a hate/love relationship with. GTA V can be a lot of things and take that however you will. The story is great, the online is a different story. Will you lose money? Probably, if you want the new stuff constantly pushed out in GTA Online. On the other hand it's a game that will never get old. It's also something that everyone has seen one way or another and so you don't need another bland recommendation review.

"I do recommend the singleplayer if you haven't played it already.I don't recommend this game's mulitplayer because it was an absolute grind. (GTA Online Review)I used mods giving money to people so they could afford things they wanted, mostly my friends. I did speed runs of heists with randoms by teleporting around to the objectives to avoid triggering Rockstar's money drop detecter. This mod took me 5 seconds to get and install which is disappointing. I enjoyed every second of modding and it added 600 hours of gameplay.I was banned twice, once for taking money to get a yacht and the second time after money was dropped on me by another hacker unwillingly, but I gained my account back just recently.I get it, people don't like hackers because they are a menace, I can understand that. However when the game nerfs missions payouts to prevent grinding, and adds cars that are increasingly more expensive and a yacht for $12M, it's unfair and needs to be rebalanced.",1.0

"EDIT 6/15/17: Really Take Two? First you leave those of us that dispise the online mode of your ♥♥♥♥ed up game in the dust. Then you take away the mods that make my game actually fun? ♥♥♥♥ off. UNINSTALLED. Thanks for the 70 somewhat gigs back. Never will I reccomend this game again.TL;DR: If you really really want this game, and I do highly reccomend the single player story, wait for a sale. This title goes down to 50% or less from time to time, nab it then.Ask me a year or two ago if I recommend this game and I would have told you yes a hundred times, but now... I just can't. First off the story is truly great, I felt like I was playing an old (PS2) GTA again. However, now all I see is Rockstar begging for money through microtransactions. Since an update, IDK how long ago, when cars began being added to online but not the single player, they've all but abandoned already, I started to lose faith. It makes me feel like I'm missing out on part of the game for no reason, why can't we have those cars in story mode exactly? ...Money that's why.I refuse to play online, I played for a short while and the community is garbage, and Rockstar seems not to care. I can go through these reviews and see plenty of other people that can't stand the thousands of ""Treavors"" the run around Los Santos and just poison the experience. But all Rockstar cares about now is the  online mode and their precious Shark cards that they know spoiled children will get their parents to buy time and time again. Microtransactions are ruining our favorite games. This needs to stop. I'd also like to see more support for those that mod the story mode as well (making the ""online only"" cars despawn if you use a trainer to enjoy them locally, really Rockstar, really???). On top of it all, if you look at the older titles (Vice City, GTA3) and you look at the reviews you'll see how Rockstar neglects their classic games. For example, it's a lottery if GTA3 will work for you. There are games older than those by other developers that still get updates. Shame Rockstar doesn't care.",1.0

"Awesome game to play with friends. Awesome story in single player and even better (in my opinion) multiplayer, even tho the hackers are sometimes annoying. I rate this game 9/10 (for the hackers in online).",1.0
"Overall impression - Very well optimized game with breathtaking visuals, lifelike animations (most of the time; very rare glitches are hilarious), incredible attention for detail, enjoyable shooting mechanics, great gameplay, top-notch dialogues and voice acting and good soundtrack. Lots and lots of things to do, huge open world, bazillion of side missions and activities, which you can (but don't have to) participate in. The world is so detailed it's almost ridiculous.9/10Single player only - As said, gameplay and visuals aside, top-notch dialogues and voice acting is one of the strongest points. The first two thirds of the story are great. Characters introduction, their motives, interaction, progress and story itself (including side missions) are simply great and it is a pleasure to play. The final third of the story felt a bit rushed to me, motives become a bit illogical and it's overall kind of uh.... meh. I was disappointed by the final act. Which is a shame. Might be only my opinion though.9/10 for first two thirds of the story and side missions, 6/10 for the final third.Multiplayer only - Lots of loading screens. Not kidding. The loading screen would get burned into old 90's monitors. Apart from this, you have to prepare for the fact that most people are d1cks and some of them are cheaters on top of that. Also, doing Heists (long co-op missions with great rewards) with strangers is not impossible, but not recommended (as soon as anyone from your team ragequits, the Heist ends for all of you and its progress is lost). Apart from these things what's left is awesome. Co-op missions, versus missions, deathmatches, races, sports, challenges, just roaming around and wreaking havoc, you name it. It's much better with friends though. Protip: do not install any mods if you plan on playing the multiplayer, you will get banned. You have been warned, do not go crying in the community hub afterwards like all the other people, you will get laughed at.7/10 without friends, 8.5/10 with friendsFinal verdict - A must-have piece of gaming history to proudly shine in your library. If you can afford it for the full price it is worth it. If you can't, get it on sale. Just get it is all I'm saying.",1.0

"It was a good game when it was released. Things made sense and the paywall for the game wasn't entirely noticable. Now the game is a mess and you have to either quit your real job to farm for one of the 200 new cars and weapons or buy a ""SharkCard"", which will give you enough money to only buy one or 2/3rd of what you really want. This is frustrating when trying to gather a full on arsenal of new goodies and RockStar has failed to impliment any way of making money that is tedious or requires me to ask my friends for their assistance at my expense. I hope they soon realize this games earning system is flawed and they address this sometime in the future.As For the OpenIV issue, it is my right as a consumer who purchased the software to modify or change anything I wish so long as it is not illegal. I understand Take 2 and RockStars point of view on this game for GTA Online, but it makes no sense to attack the single player modding community that would help their game for years to come. It is sad to see a company like RockStar/Take 2 to be doing this to their loyal customers and I am offended that they have not made a claim regarding the issue of OpenIV. From now on I will no longer be spending my money on any of Rockstars up coming products and I will make sure to spread the word.Also Congratulations on losing a customer!tldr: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!",1.0

"If you don't own GTAV for PC, get it. It is honestly an amazing game alone or with friends and considering I wasn't 100% on-board on getting it, my mind has definitely been changed for the better.Single PlayerThe single player campaign is extremely good and fleshed out, amazing if you have a weekend or so without internet and need a catching and enjoyable story to play. While lacking after completion, modding is definitely something to consider if you are careful with your installations and an amazing community means there is always something to try out.PRO's- Great story with 3 great characters leads me to believe a new GTA won't be able to ever beat it. - Characters are interesting to say the least but all lead to an overall amazing.- Open world is diverse with countless opportunities for chaos and shenanigans.- Modding community is great (although players have to be careful with installation and usage with online)- Choice with some important decisions give you some control over the direction as to how missions and jobs play out, but generally stays the same no matter what.CON's- Little replay-ability- Single Player modding could get you banned online if not careful- After finishing campaign there is little to do unless you enjoy searching for plants and scraps of paper.- No new contentOnlineOnline is where most of my hours have been chugged. At first glance it is grindy, unfair and chaotic. At second glance it's exactly the same. But through all of it, a good crew and a bit of time can make you rich and keep you entertained for a long time ahead. While many complain that online is repetitive and grindy like an MMO, GTA:O can definitely be a fun time with friends or a trustable crew. As long as you are smart with what you do and how you deal with people in-game, you won't regret playing.PRO's- Vast and ""interesting"" community- Constantly updated- Customisability and individuality- Insanely fun when the top dogCON's- Forces you to grind for money unless you want to pay for microtransactions.- Only really good money making methods are exploits or grinding ~10 hours.- A lot of players are KOS- Modders/Hackers are uncommon but painful (only have found ~6 in 260 hours).- Newer players are helpless unless they play smart.- Can be banned for single-player modding.- Money = Power9/10 - Single player is amazing, Online is hell until you acquire cash. In the world of GTA, Money = Power. And this is the evidence of it. Get this game on sale or for full price. Either or, you won't regret it. Only thing that lowers the score for me at least is the single-player modding issues that you could face if done incorrectly, but overall this game is great. ",1.0

I do know that i will not be buying anything from these two companys again as without mods gta dies off after the story is over and online isn't my thing.

"Wow...such a great game under this veil of ineptitude.  I absolutely cannot recommend this game until they figure out how to get the game running without Social Club DRM failing to initialize.  Don't get me wrong.  The game itself is epic.  The problem here, for me at least, is that I can maybe play 30 seconds to up to 30 minutes before the game game crashes and an error message stating ""Failed to initialize"" appears on the Rockstar Social Club overlay.  I contacted support about this and they gave me all sorts of suggestions in the first couple of days, none of which fixed the issue.  Then suddenly, no more response from Rockstar.  They basically just left me hanging.  I originally bought this game on my PS3...so I've already played through it.  I bought it on PC because I was excited to use mods, then the crashes started happening, then I read this article:http://www.pcgamer.com/grand-theft-auto-5-patch-kills-mod-support/So buyer beware, as of this review, constant game crashes and no mod support.

"The first GTA I've actually enjoyed. Bacause of the first person camera viewpoint but mainly because they've tightened up the driving physics (although the traction is still  like driving on snow (you can travel about 200 metres along the sand on a beached Jetski)) and included a driver's eye-line camera viewpoint (although it does turn into a chest-cam on vehicles like the quad bike).But all told, a really really enjoyable experience.

 If you have not played GTA V you are missing out on the best possible gaming experience there is at the given moment. The story is amazing and the online is even better.

"Before I start I would like you to know this is an opinionated review and it's my perspective so there is no right or wrong. its agree or disagree. For me I have played GTAV on xbox360 and now pc. The game is very good I think there are more pros then cons however the cons are strong enough to make someone dislike the game.{If you dont want to read large descriptions I have summarised down the bottum}Playable : This game has a really high system requirements. I am running this game with : i7 processor, Nividia graphics card and 8 GB ram and even with this much my computer is struggling to handle the game at medium. If I had to play the game on low it be a huge let down as we all have paid a high price for some high quality game.Graphics : I feel this game is already well known for its outstanding graphics. Even though I have this game at medium - low it's still an extreme beautiful game.The first person shooter aspect is really well thought out. I have to say I enjoy getting into fights when in first person even when you get shot it's just fun.Narrative :I will not spoil however It is a really good campaign the only problem with it is you cannot play campaign offline.(As far as I am aware this has not updated)Repetitive : This game would not be one you play straight for a long time however you would play this game for a short period then wait a while and play it again another time. For me I found that playing straight would only bore and frustrate me. Online : The online in this game is very big. I'm not on about the map but the amount of detail in the offline mode. It may have more detail then story mode. There is  three downsides to the online mode. 1 - The game lobbies are not monitored enough (luckily for the raggers)2 - Some of the time the community can make it difficult for lower level people.3 - It's very difficult to get money in free roam3 = I would like to go into detail on this because it's not entirely true.The game offers challenges in free roam mode that allow you to gain money for example, Armored cars - These are large vehicles that can carry up to 12 000 cash(varies) and all it requires you to do is shoot the driver the bust the back open. The argument to this is you never know when you're going to see one and they are apparently activated through missions. However Online is mostly positive and if you game at all you will enjoy it. (Sorry anyone into Fantasy rag May not count for you)Everything buyable is restricted to your level however some things can be obtainable through collection in free roam or missions. Not just that you can play games like  golf and darts. (these are only 2 of the minicamps)Now there are mini games and secondary games. GTAV is lots of games in one, Racing, first person shooter and third person shooter etc.The games also got a party system so you can host private servers (I'm not sure if that works on pc so don't hold me to it)The best thing about Online is that unlike single player you can have hours of fun with more than 4 people however there are some missions that are controlled by the amount of people (you cannot go over the set amount of people in missions) And the missions affect your character. He/She gains stats for strength, driving, flying etc. I could go on and on about how good the online is however id only bore you with unnecessary information that you would probably ignore. Here is the simple version :My opinion :Graphics = AmazingPlayable = go over minimum stats and then yes + Not offlineNarrative = Good Repetition = Singleplayer- bad  Online - GoodOnline = Excelent (3 problems)Community = [25% - Bad sports]  [65%  - Average] [10% - Good people] (This is made up stats and is not 100% true but it is a estimate) Do I recomend this game : YesHowever,If you want to buy Grand theft auto V There are two things you need to keep in mind.1 - This Game is 100% online and you cannot play it without being connected to social club.2 - This game is not for you don't have over the requirements of the hardware.Apoligies this is a very long review its my first and I wanted it to be very accurate as this game deserves it.",1.0

"Well. GTA V is good game. Yeah, the single player GTA. The GTA that we all will remember as being THE GTA.Grand Theft Auto was always some kind of magic formula for me. I love GTA series overall. I played countless hours in GTA III, VC, SA. Less on IV and V. Therefore, 3D era will be in my heart forever. 100% completion of each of 3D era GTA is A MUST to get best experience.Now, lets get to bad apple, GTA Online.Online is a place, where a person, who bought a ""Starter Pack"" with most expensive ""Shark Card"" (which is a bad trade, to be honest), can obliterate you in a ""press X"" fashion. While you, a player with more than 1k+ combined hours of  gameplay on oldgen and nextgen GTA V/Online, can do nothing. That is called ""Orbital Cannon"". Want to do same to your opponent? Welp, best hope is to get some sweet microtransactions to go, as grinding will increase your hour count by more than it must.And i am genuinely disappointed because of all this militarized vehicles and futuristic nonsense. It is just infuriating, when you drive your sweet top-range car on export mission and some player flying over on deluxo, shooting homing missiles at you. GTA was already a parody on real life, but was in a borders of real-world stuff. In other words, in our universe with all the social/political problems dialed all the way up. But this. THIS ONE IS JUST CRAZY.Modders are a problem. But not so much as griefers or KD freaks, as R* give everyone an opportunity to successfully obliterate everyone with Opressor and Hydra-esque plane. Just give them enough money and here you go! Your griefing tool will be delivered in no time. Thank you for using Pegasus Lifestyle Management.In conclusion -- every new car, plane, boat, office, weapon, mod, heist and pretty much everything, including clothes (yeah, CLOTHES), will cost you more with each next DLC. Paywalls are freaking immeasurable. Battlefront II? EA, lookup to R*!BTW, if you missed conversion point for online accounts, you are in a bad situation, my friend.",1.0
"Rockstar Games' parent company Take Two Interactive forcefully shut down the development of alternative multiplayer platforms, FiveM and GTA:MP. Which is horrible considering the guys at FiveM and GTA:MP, with extremely limited resources, built (or tried to build) a better product than Rockstar Games did with GTA Online.Single Player does not appeal after being beaten once and GTA Online is saturated with issues and there is nothing to do after 50-100 hours. Yes, you can (try to) have fun with friends in a private session, if all goes well. But thats just not enough.I hope someone at Take Two Interactive realises that mods prolong the life of a game on PC. For example, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Even after 5 years, its still one of the top selling games. Even Rockstar Games' own Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, which is still active even after more than a decade has passed since its release. This is because of the mods (SA:MP and MTA:SA). Also take a look at Just Cause 2. They have an official Multiplayer Mod which is infact built by the community.This is probably the last game I ever pre-ordered, and definitely the last game I will buy from Take Two Interactive, atleast at the full price. They have overlooked community needs to earn profits. And when the community tried to build something on their own, they used their power to crush them. Unless they change their attitude towards what a consumer / community wants.So long.",1.0

They just don't seem to understand that one of the things most people buy GTA on PC for explicitly is to play around with mods. Using a trainer online is one thing and is certainly an issue, but mods like LSPDFR, mods that bring in characters like Hulk or even Harry Potter, you know, mods that in no way affect the multiplayer aspect of GTA 5 will probably get the boot now. Rockstar makes great games, but they just don't get their playerbase it seems.",1.0
"First of all, I bought this game during sales and would have never buy it another period because the price is too high. This is one of the must-have game, but still the price of gta V makes it not affordable for everyone. Ok i bought this game, fine. Ok  60GB+ of downloading and installing the game. Fine. I started the story, really great, characters are awesome blablabla. I try the online game. AND THEN, it began, my hate for this game. Sometimes you have to wait for 10minutes just to find and load an online session. You start playing, get killed by 10 years old kids. Fine. You start having a good stuff, and suddenly everyone is disconnecting, ""failed to connect to rockstar servers"". Fine, that's not like I was online for 2 hours but fine. I'm still loading since 21:30 it's now 21:42. I retry for the 2nd time right now. Ok i can finally play, enjoy the great graphics, yeah that's cool, waiting in a lobby for 10 minutes cus' no one come. Ok fine. Yes another cons i found : ROCKSTAR. Their servers just lags 1 time out of 3 and that's ♥♥♥♥ing annoying. Ok i finally join a session and play with my friends. While i'm still waiting for the game to load its 21:47. So :PROS: -Story is cool-Characters are well-made-Good graphics-Good stuff that is keeping added by Rockstar which is pretty niceCONS:-LAAAAAAAAG on  rockstar servers -The game that load for ages and ages-Sometimes it's so freaking long to find people to join your lobby-The price of the game that is too high for a 2013 game even if pc version was added 2 years ago. Rockstar takes advantage of their position as developpers of the most sold game of the last years.-I'm still loading it's now 21:52 i restarted the game twice while my friend is waiting for me.IN CONCLUSION: Do not buy this game unless you have time to lose, or want to get under the control of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the marketing section at RockstarAND MY GAME FINALLY LOADED IN OFFLINE MODE WOUHOU ITS 21:56oh waiti tried to get on online and guess what ?♥♥♥♥ing timed out to connect to rockstar serversu know what?♥♥♥♥ this game, ♥♥♥♥ the developpers (not really but yes), ♥♥♥♥ the marketing employees that make this game a cancer and ♥♥♥♥ THE WHOLE WORLDomg its 22:03 and i joined a gamewould not recommend this game at all -10/10IGN",1.0
"EDIT: Apparently Rockstar decided it would be smart to remove any form of community modding (workshop functionality, in it's essence), and in doing so, ended up killing off a massive part of it's community. Rest in peace, Grand Theft Auto V.Alright, I did a review on GTAV a few months ago, and gave it a positive review because of how well I was able to play the game, and how the game preformed in general. A few months later, I'm gonna have to say no, and here's a few reasons for that;1. Broken Anti-Cheat: R* put lots of time and effort into creating GTAV and polished the game to perfection before releasing. Unfortunately, the online mode is abysmal compared to the normal game, with a custom anti-cheat system from R* that fails to complete it's job and doesn't fulfill it's purpose. With that system in place many players who join lobbies with hackers and griefers end up getting the boot while hackers remain (Somehow.?) undetected. This was bad enough that when I happened to join a lobby with a hacker, I ended up being banned FOREVER just for being abused by that one player. Good Times.2. Un-Professional Support: After the issue mentioned above occurred, I did the first thing a player usually does when an error like this occurs on any server, and tried to contact R* online support. I went to their site, explained the issue, and waited for a response. Two days later a rep from R* responded by what seemed like copypasta from an employee manual, completely ignoring the evidence I had given and clearly DID NOT read anything mentioned in my ticket. I responded, requesting live support from  R*, and was dissed at by one of their support officials. IF you do manage to come across an  issue like this, please, just use Reddit (You'll probably get better, more friendly support there anyways.)3. In-Game Purchases: So, Imagine yourself as R* for a second. You make a bestseller game that's sold millions of copies on the steam store, and with each copy selling for 59.99$ (On a normal basis, not including sales) you should be pretty well set financially right? RIGHT?? Nope. One of the most disappointing features about the game is that they decided to introduce Shark Cards to online play, where players can choose to buy currency to buy other in game items with. Originally, players were fine with this since they were able to make enough money through missions and heists, causing the cards not to sell very well. Of course R* noticed this and in an attempt to up card sales, DLC and Update related cars prices continue to rise in a sad attempt to get players to purchase money. I could continue listing the numerous errors with the game, but because I still have a small amount of hope for the game, I'll wait and see what R* decides in an attempt fix the game. Until then, I have no interest in the game, as simply refunding the game isn't satisfying (Deleting it from my library felt pretty redeeming, though). I Give the game as of now a 3/10",1.0

Great game,1.0
"This game used to have a singleplayer campaign with great replayability. Used to.But then Take Two Interactive decided to legally threaten the developers of a popular free mod under false pretenses. A mod which had been out for almost a decade.I can not in good conscience recommend anyone to buy this game now. If it is on sale for 10 bucks, sure. Otherwise - STAY AWAY! (Oh, and Online is infested with hackers, so it is not worth it.)",1.0
"****UPDATE****Lets be honest. There is a extremely high chance that Rockstar even got the idea for the gun running update is through mods made by the passionate community. But in the end the poor treatment of mods is utterly disgusting thanks to them shutting down OpenIV with a cease and desist order, despite it having NO interaction with the online portion of the game. A software used for modding in the GTA community for a long time.TLDR: ♥♥♥♥ you, rockstar and take two interactice. You greedy, pieces of♥♥♥♥♥♥ Bring back OpenIV. You could not have ♥♥♥♥ed up more majestically and reduced the value of your game by a ♥♥♥♥ing landslide. My opinion? Don't support the Devs any further in anyway. If they take our freedom to mod the game in order to enhance our playing experience, they in NO WAY deserve our hard earned money and support. Enjoy watching your already dying game, die further with its falling player base. No one wants to play vanilla.*****ORIGINAL REVIEW*****Don't. Just don't bother unless its HEAVILY discounted.You're really gonna have a great time with the single player. Its fun with 3 interesting characters and supporting cast and a really well held story with a living breathing open world with fun side missions to keep you interested. Story mode is amazing.Then comes the multiplayer. This part of the game is why majority of people buy this game. And to save you: DON'T. I personally have had more disgust than fun with this mode.The servers are ♥♥♥♥ing ABYSMAL. It consists of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ peer to peer connection time that gets you timed out during the PAINFULLY long loading screens (Takes me atleast 15 mins to join a server and even more to join a friend's server). And if you are lucky and do end up joining, there is a chance that you will be disconnected by every player in the server leaving within the next few minutes. And even if that doesn't happen, prepare to experience the most annoying rubber banding and lag in your life.Matchmaking is terrible as well. It mostly connects you with players that are much more privilaged than you. This can be from over powered armoured vehicles to weapons of sorts. Instead of just matchmaking people of our level and experience. This also occurs during soloing heists. People with unbalanced weapons just keep taking all the experience leaving none for yourself.There is no region selector so most of the time you can enter a server where the players dont speak english/ your native language. Not only that, giving a terrible amount of latency due to this. There is no Anti-cheat system in the game, so hackers and modders (which is something im greatly opposed to) can run around lighting you on fire at critical moments and ♥♥♥♥ all happens to them. Majority of servers are RIDDLED with them. Leaving ligitimate players of the game to feel no satisfaction due to their hard work and grit. The modders and cheaters will get a ban, but it isn't strict enough. Its usually for a month or 2 months, rather than a permanent ban.Out of my 60+ hours in total, 30 hours has been dedicated to the online portion of the game. And for those of you who say that 30 hours isn't enough to experience online as a whole and that you havent experienced any of the issues mentioned above, know that majority of the player base have come across these issues and 30 hours is MORE THAN ENOUGH to get a full idea of it. Because you haven't, doesnt mean that said issues doesnt exist. So to conclude:Story mode 10/10 (♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Masterpiece)Online: 4/10 (Trash)** If you want a good open world multiplayer experience, play the online mod for GTA San Andreas. You'll have miles more fun than this trash.",1.0

"I loved the game when it came out, now it's just more of a grindfest than a Korean MMO... The multiplayer is nothing but pay to win at this point, you cannot have a lot of fun without spending millions upon millions of in game dollars. The multiplayer's just a microtransaction vessel and that alone is really saddening. I can only recommend it for the singleplayer, for singleplayer mods and for playing online with friends, but apart from that I wouldn't buy it for the full price.",1.0
"tl;dr Unless you're willing to pay 60-80 bucks to horse around with your friends, I can't recommend it.I had a friend pre-order this for him and I and I love playing it with him and my close group of friends, My problem with the game is that the single player is just okay.I've enjoyed all of the previous GTA game's progression. Watching your character grow and the game slowly get bigger and bigger. This one is all layed out to you from the beginning. I guess that's ok, but there's no real sense of accomplishment for me when the city doesn't evolve with your character.On top of that, the character arcs were not very big. Pretty small actually. I don't feel like anybody gained power or influence or grew much as an individual. At the very end of the single player I felt like I had just finished chapter 1 of 4 as far as character development goes.But all that aside, unless you're playing specifically with friends, multiplayer is unplayable. Rockstar will evidently ban you if you leave your mods on, and if you don't you'll be faced with constant jackassery and hacking. I couldn't keep a PUG together for a heist ONCE. Which is sad, because the heists are a HUGE part of the fun of the multiplayer. I was really disappointed to find out that the new content didn't expand/include this.",1.0

Your suspension expiration date is shown on the splash screen after being returned to Story Mode following an attempt to play online. In addition to being suspended, all GTA Online characters, progress and inventory on {PLATFORM} will be reset. Any funds purchased via Shark Cards has been preserved and is still available on your account. The next infraction on your account will result in a permanent ban from GTA Online.

Story mode is fun. Online not so. Why? So much hackers. They make playing in online mode very hard. Rockstar really needs to fix this!,1.0
"Unlike most players i don't think the storyline is incomplete, i just think it makes no sense at all, Rockstar made an appealing game and then wanted to rip money off everybody not caring about anything using the well established reputation called GTA franchise that has thousands of thousands of fans worldwide shoving the “shark cards” down our throats, the story consists in the ""ultimate score"" has described ""The Pacific Standard Heist"" where the player gets thousands of bucks or tens of euros (hehe), just looking superficial how much sense does it make to spend millions to get... obtain... thousands? taking the facilities aside, I am not taking that into this equation, you are spending millions to steal a bank and get... thousands, the ammo you lose until you get to that point, all the cars, houses, vests, all that stuff, the minigun is 50k alone that is minus 50k from the 250k you win at best if you’re not hosting, poor planning on the spot there from Rockstar, if you just want to play in single forget it, talk about boring, sure you can replay the missions, but who wants to eat the same piece of food again and again and again and again till you die, children get punished like that when they don't eat their veggies, we all saw that in some point “kid you are not leaving that table until you eat that”, multiplayer is messed up, Rockstar says they have a hard hand on hackers, between me and them we must have different definitions of the word ""hard"", must be a cultural thing I don't know... but in my country a ""hard hand"" is... well... after used a person needs some time before doing the same thing all over again and we have no problems in saying or even showing that, in ""Rockstar world"" it even seems to be encouraged to happen all over again, not saying this just because of how much cash we lose with hackers, and they must see it has a opportunity to sell shark cards, after all there is more hackers every day since the game started, but it seems most hackers suspensions happens when they get bored playing the game, we all see player with 900 to 20k lvls, how many hours did those guys played? How can they not be cheating? in fact who has more than 1k hours of playing and still hasn’t meet the “flawless Rockstar support”? I call it flawless because they say they are, in every reply, this means we are the ones with a problem because we contacted them... every time it seems like they are saying “Why you contacted me? Fix your own problems, get mods like them” Rockstar system is at best unstable, targets players randomly, if they use hacks or not it is irrelevant, which is odd don’t get me wrong we all had a whinny the poo kid crying “he used hacks on me” at some point in our life’s, and he probably reported us all, you because you probably used it, me because I am not a smart guy, I will not stop trying to kill you until the map runs out, it’s a PVP, GO PASSIVE (you have a option called “passive” that prevents other players from killing you, if they kill you then they are hacking, but before that it is just because it is fun to kill you again and again) and also why are you crying? See the bullet holes in my car? What did you expected to happen when you made them? And then my friend gets suspended and I get a car restriction... good one Rockstar... Refunds... they remind me those Chinese stores people use has stereotypes. Honestly I had a bad idea about Chinese stores until I used Rockstar’s GTA V so in fact Rockstar tooked that away from me because I am an honest person, Rockstar made the world a even worst place to be, I can no longer say that I only get ripped off like that in a shady Chinese store, so in fact if you ask a refund you get a “no lefund” but they know how to type, they must be educated or some stuff, I expect anything from them, terrible people, all the worst things, so you will get “sorry, we can’t...” when in fact they should not be able is to upset players not making us say “how awful people they are”, I even sound like Trump talking about these people, but unlike him, people agree, they actually agree with me, in so many reviews, Rockstar you are awful!!! You had a great game, great ball running prospects has you Americans like to say describing a game called football that is played with your hands, that is why I said “cultural differences” also, makes no sense but again and you dropped it when you target players for playing and not targeting hackers for... hacking.... in a game where you go from being able to sell 1 car hourly for instance let’s say you sell 10 cars daily and you get down to 3 daily with the hourly restriction what does that tell you? We think you are saying “you’re stupid for buying our game RIP” the game is called “GRAND THEFT AUTO” not “GRAND THEFT AUTO WITH RESTRICTIONS”!!! Let’s continue when you are playing a game designated PvP (Player Versus Player) the last thing you expect is getting suspended or banned for... “Killing too many players” 1 how many people do I have to kill to get 1 of those?!?!? My friend, the one that got that didn’t remember how many he killed, he just said “I must have spent thousands of bucks on ammo, and killed all those braves souls that shot at me” I would be upset of being suspended or banned don’t get me wrong, but... still I feel offended he got it and I didn’t, feel left out (randomly targeting system), after all I was right there shooting and NOT missing also, how many he got more than me?!?! Let’s not get off the topic you get a suspension or you get banned for killing players in a PVP game... again poor planning on the spot Rockstar, I only got the car restriction... The funny part of the game is that they actually expect us to just take it and shut upEdited: After more then 1 month trying to talk with rockstar customer support the only answer i got was that they could not fix the issue, if hacks were involved or not were irrelevant and requesting that i should contact the developers... this alone shows where the bar of their professionalism stands if you decide to buy gta V or even gta VI it will be your fault if they suspend or ban you for playing, not hacking, simply playing has their customer support will later reply you has they did me, your refund request will simply be ignored",0.0

It is an amazing open world game and u have to play it!,1.0
"I've waited 3 years to get this game. Since it came out for the consoles I wanted it really badly. But was it worth waiting 3 years? When it came out my friend bought for the PS3 it and we played it together when I came over. I really enjoyed that. But now I finally got it myself and, oh yeah it is hell of a game, it's even better on pc. GTA V Story mode So the story mode is fun and the story is pretty good. I'm not even near to completing it even though I have played the game for more than 80 hours. Other than the story just going walk around doing fun stuff is great! Climbing mountains, stealing jets, pimping some car you stole, heavy police chases, stunts, skydiving and many more thing to do. Gta V isn't just story mode but it's a race game, a shooter, life simulator, sports game (lol) IT'S JUST EVERYTHING! Even though in my opinion it isn't as fun as online. Something though whenever you buy a car and if it is lost or destroyed you can't get it back that is disapointing, at online you just call your insurance and they get it back for ya. Further there is nothing bad about it's just very solidly made by Rockstar. GTA V Online So this what I've played most, in two weeks I've played 64 hours. This is just so addicting. Along the road you meet new people, you make friends, and with them you can have so much fun. In my opinion GTA V is better in multiplayer, and having an own character. So here you have everything, just everything you have at Story mode plus on top of that you have own MC clubs, own company's, you can buy more garages and apartments, you can do all the things in Story mode with your friends as yourself. It's your character, you write the story. But now the bad things. Even though it's better than Story mode it has more bad points. For example Shark cards, I mean I bought 100k for 2.5 Euro's that is still okay but 75 Euro's for 8 million Rockstar what??? Buying Shark cards up to 10 Euro's is normal but above that it is a waste of money. I've heard a lot of stupid things about unfair bans, it hasn't happened to me but it is really stupid and Rockstar should do something about it. For someone who hasn't been banned yet and really enjoys playing online it's just scary to know that you could get banned anytime for no reason. Please fix. But other than those 2 things everything is really great and I haven't even covered all the positive things, neither the bad but this are the most important things in my opinion. GTA V Online,  PASS . Conclusion GTA V is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life. It's just so great that some games don't even have a chance to compete with it. It has some bad points some good points, but all games have good and bad points. This is an almost perfect game. Rockstar good job! Definitely recommended for everyone!",1.0

In addition, the amount of modders/hackers are gamebreaking. They could get you banned easily, by killing everyone and blaming you (Putting your name as the killer), or can add money into your account causing stats to reset and a ban by Rockstar. Also, the customer service Rockstar provides is absolutely terrible. They barely reply, and if they do, it's no help. In conclusion, get this game if you enjoy getting repitetively trapped/killed by modders, and if you enjoy getting banned",0.0
"The game is a blast. Really fun and a good time sink.The single player is amazing, very good story and fun to play and had some great laughs. The only problem I have with the game is multiplayer or GTA 5 Online.I enjoy Online using friend invites or solo mode but the problem with online is rockstar and modders.   Rockstar has no real anti cheat detection to ban just the modders.   So modders will go in and give free money and do others things which can get normal playeras banned for no reason and even if you didn't do anything rock star will perm ban you or ban you for 30 days either way you lose your character and all you worked for online.So be cautious when playing online in a public server.  Even if you didn't do anything you could still get banned.Also make sure to check for graphic card patches, in some case in the early days of the game people with MSi GPU's would get banned for something and couldn't get online but still able to play Single player.",1.0
"Don't get me wrong, I love this game and it's one of my favorite games of all time, mind you, but this new news is too disappointing. I doubt many people may have heard the news, since it was pushed over by everything else at e3, but all mods (and the company that makes mods for singleplayer) got a cease and desist, and are being removed in the game just to get more people to play online, which is already rife with microntransactions. I mean, take a look at the hydra; it's already in multiplayer, not buggy at all, but Rockstar and 2K refuse to put it in single player, just so they can drag more people into their money-hungry multiplayer. TL;DR: Great game, so much fun and I would reccomend the buy, however you should wait if you want to show support for the mods being taken away.",1.0

"Great single player campaign one of the best however once you have finished this the replayability has becomes pretty much non existent unless you want to just replay the exact same campaign for the following reasons1. They have gotten rid of all single player mods due to their unparalleled greed. They don't want you playing single player because their is no need for shark cards there..at least not yet but I wouldn't be surprised if that happens too.2. GTA online was a good mode that was turned to trash and in my opinion is not worth playing. They have turned it into a grindfest in order to sell shark cards it's totally unbalanced and reminds me of fifa online absolute trash. They purposely hugely increased the grind to force people to buy shark cards3. Game is filled with hackers and even without hackers if your not pumping in real world cash it's going to be pretty unbalanced with you on the wrong end. 4. Unlikely ever to make single player expansions because they don't want you playing single player because it competes with online shark cards and why would they want to pay people to make content for your mone when they can sell you shark cards which cost zero dollars to produce an infinite quantity of5. They can ban you and reset all your progress if they ""suspect"" you have cheated and you are not allowed to appeal. So even if you grind like crazy or by your shark cards all your stuff can be taken off you even if you do nothing wrong.I have low playtime as I owned this previously on ps4 and re bought but with the grinding being increased exponentially what I once though was a great game has become unplayable garbage because rockstar on take 2 believe they are under monitoring lolThis companys behaviour reminds me of the behaviour of Pablo escobar in the TV show narcosShark cards should be boycott ",1.0

"What a truely amazing game 10/10 however, the customer supprt is rude and Rockstar/taketwo interactive blatent disregard for it's fanbase is utterly disgusting and the fact that rockstar can ban your account for NO reason what so ever and without knowing what you are banned for is dispicible . I have read comments on other forums of children posting their problems and it is heart rendering to know that a major large comapny can just take your money and run without ANY repercussion what so ever, a 'ban wave' that bans the inncoent and rewards the hackers and cheats.I recommend never purcahesing a take two/rockstar title ever again for this reason.",1.0

All you seem to do is f*ck over your customers in pursuit of money from your buyers. From here on out I will make it a point to no longer buy anything from T2 or R* until something is done about this on your part. Too bad you will die the villain instead of the hero. F*ck you.",1.0

"So, I mostly played this on my Xbox one, ergo why I haven't clocked many hours on PC.This game's pretty, smooth controls, and it's just generally a good GTA game, if you want it.However, certain events, some recent, some not, have made this game a no-buy in my book.Firstly, the multiplayer is pretty much ruined. It's almost impossible to find a game that isn't plagued by hackers and cheaters. The publisher and developer haven't taken any steps to fix this problem that's been around for 2 years now. This is certainly funny if you're watching a youtube video, but it gets old quickly.Second, it no longer runs well on most PC systems. I don't know what happened, but a few patches ago changed the game so that it's now far more taxing on most systems. Systems like mine, with a GTX1080, are barely able to hit a solid 50fps , even in single player. And there doesn't seem to be any consisteny to it. I've had friends with specs far less than mine be able to run this game just fine, but they're the minority.Thirdly, the publishers, which are NOT Rockstar Games, but actually Take Two Interactive, have suddenly threatened modding teams with legal action. As a result, almost all mods are now completely unavailable. You know, mods, the things that've kept this game current for 2 years?Terrible anti-consumer practices by the publishers and shoddy work all around.So yeah, don't buy this game. At the very least, don't buy it on PC, 'cause there's no reason to any more. Even if you did get it to run without too many problems, it's still the worst version.",0.0

I am very disappointed with the way rockstar and take-two 's descisions to not only not create any new single player content but move more towards the paid dlcs. the online is almost possible to get into due to the ridiculous high cost of everything. you have to buy shark cards if you hope to have any fun. they are also making it impossible to mod even the single player why take that away from people for no reason at all. rockstar is going in a horrible direction and im very worried about the future of their games.,1.0

"Well, been waiting a while to buy this game on PC. Thinking there won't be much modders and that it will be top notch security or what not.How mistaken I was when I bought it. After the mission to get the drugs I was about to go to the clothes shop, you know? To look ♥♥♥♥ing great. Then boom, I kept getting blown up over and over, constantly. Unfair to be honest. Anyway, I thought meh, another server then!I did, I DID! I went on another server! Then right before me was a player with something huge attatched to him. What the fudge is this!? I run away, of course. Sighing, I didn't want the game anymore, not when there is so much modders ruining the game. It isn't GTA Online.. No, nonono. It's MODDERS ONLINE!

"Rockstar and Take2 (the companies who own the GTA IP) have really done nothing but proven themselves to be user-hostile greedy businessmen with the release of this game. Please allow me to enumerate just a smidge of the countless issues that have come from this game's four-year lifespan, in chronological order.1) Console Exclusivity - multiple delays for PC release.All of the PC gamers who were excited for the fifth rendition of the GTA franchise were put on hold a number of times - delaying the release of the PC version of the game by 2 whole years after the original release on the XBox and PS3 in 2013.2) Post-release game development issuesLoading screens for this gigantic (70gb+ game) last into the 10s of minutes, even with it being loaded on my SSD in my $1200+ rig and my 400Mbps+ internet. That is for EVERYTHING. Going into online itself, joining races, heists, your apartment, etc. This is not a localized issue, I see this complained about everywhere. Adding to the overall clunkiness of the online scene of this game is the poorly developed netcode for the online mode. Rockstar used a meshnet-esque connection type instead of localized dedicated servers because running servers is expensive. The choice of using such a connection means almost all checks for hacks and cheats for multiplayer are client-side (essentially meaning anyone can gain access to cheats for this game with little to no experience required.)3) Singleplayer not being on-par with multiplayer.There are multiple examples of this but one that is very prominant is the fact that you cannot get the Hydra (a very popular jet) in singleplayer. The Hydra is only found in the Online mode.4) In-game-text is censored.I have and always will be baffled by the absurdity of this part. You cannot say any sort of curse word in the game's text chat. They are automatically censored. You also cannot say rockstar or R* or any major online  company in the chat. I find it so bewildering that a rated M game featuring hookers, strip clubs, extreme violence, and even cutscenes with those same banned curse words in them would not allow players to communicate with each other in such a way. This doesn't seem like a big deal, but you cannot even say something like West Virginia without it being censored. Why? Because 'virgin' is a naughty word, according to rockstar. My personal opinion of this is that it is a cash grab - it allows parents to feel safe that their 12 year old is playing a game because ""other people aren't saying naughty things to them"". Just a possibility.5) Toxic community.Adding onto my previous point, the fanbase for this sort of game is a bunch of hormonal 14 year olds who have no maturity and make their only goal in the game to upset you as much as possible. I can't even explain how many times I have had to use the ""Find New Session"" button only to be joined with a new lobby containing even more toxicity or even the same people who were bothering me before. It's awful.6) Microtransactions and pure cash-grabs.Users who play this game will find everything to be extremely overpriced. 1 million dollars in this game can get you one low-end apartment. No cars. No decent weapons, etc. How much does it cost in real money to get 1 million in-game? $20 (well, $19.99). The ""shark cards"" in this game cost up to $100usd and can give you up to $8 million. Earning money in this game is extremely difficult and time-consuming. a full set of heists (around 4 hours of gameplay) will earn you around $700,000. Insanity. Rockstar and Take2 are all about double-dipping into their consumer's wallets with this game, having microtransactions on top of a $60 (despite it being 4 years old) game. 7) All steam sales have been screwy with this game.Rockstar has never let this game dip below $39.99. When it goes on sale, instead of lowering the price, they just bundle in $1mil in-game money and call it good. This, combined with microtransactions, and the fact that it was released on console for full price and then on pc for full price just creates a triple-dip that Rockstar and Take2 have been loving to take advantage of. 8) This game is filled with constant hackers.Rockstar and Take2 have further proven their apathy when it concerns customers by their actions about online hacking in the game. Hacking is so prevalent that I have had only about 1 in 6 sessions where there is NOT a hacker present in the game. Hackers have full control over everything, including wiping your hard-earned cash and cash that you have paid for via shark cards(for good, thanks to the awful netcode and development for the online platform of this game), killing you, crashing your game and/or computer, DDoSing you, and more.9) Take2 has sent Private Investigators to mod creator's homes.This one is honestly pretty self explanatory.10) Take2's CEO has said that they have ""intentionally UNDERmonetized"" their users. So $60 for the four-year-old game, endless microtransactions, and a double release is UNDERmonetizing your users? I don't think so, Take2.11) Take2 has sent Cease and Decist letters to the creators of OpenIV, a mod that allows for the creation of singleplayer-only mods for this game. Take2 does not care about the creative community behind its own games, simple as that. OpenIV did absolutely nothing wrong and Take2 decided they didn't want to deal with it. This review is honestly only covering the surface of this game's issues. I really would like to see some improvement on Take2 and Rockstar's side before I changed my review.",0.0

They do admit it is the system that bans, but they don't do anything if the system gets glitched and bans half the GTA players. I decided to ask why I got banned, copy-pasted reply. I then asked them how to bake cookies as I obviously needed a new hobby, and I got that same copy-pasted response. I asked how to bake cookies, and I was told they don't remove a ban from an account...Rockstar. Don't expect any of my cookies.",1.0
"I have to fight off the temptation to write a lot about this game. There's so much to talk about!However I don't want to waste your time or mine, there are plenty of in-depth reviews online. So to keep it short and sweet: Probably one of my favourite games of all time! In the top 30 or so anyway, which is a tall order seeing as I've been playing games since the zx-spectrum days. Great visuals, great music, amazing open world environment, interesting characters (I agree that Trevor is the star, but the others have their place and are part a balance). The storyline was decent enough, although it's the free-form playing that's the most fun. I clocked 109 hours and probably over 80 hours of that was just roll-playing the characters and getting lost in the detailed and gorgeous open world. It's the flexibility of the mechanics and interaction of the worlds elements that makes the game so much fun. One session I might be having a car chase/gun battle on a golf cart after a golf match gone wrong, ending by watching the sunset next to my battered golf cart on the beach. Another time I might be just listening to music while working as a taxi driver. It's varied and lots of fun. It's my favourite GTA game, it's awesome and I loved my time in it. 10/10",1.0

If none of these bother you though, the graphics are top-notch, the destructible environment is pretty awesome, and the notoriety mechanic(at least at low wanted levels) is fairly easy to beat.

"I am updating my last review to shine a final light on GTAV. A summary would be like this:GTA 5 is a luxurious ice cream, mixed with vanilla, chocolate and strawberry flavors with a beautiful Canterbury Bell on top, making it look like a high class desert, designed specifically to give you a taste of heaven with every bite.  The moment ice cream touches your tongue, you feel like flying. You feel like a feather. Then as you take a second and then a third bite, the taste only gets better. You can't control your hand, as it automatically goes for more and more, while your tongue dances and body tingles with happiness. It's like you're back to being a kid, who was eating his first ice cream in the middle of hot summer, while your parents looked at you with bright smiles on their faces. But as you progress through this delicious paradise, you're met with a dark brown cream. You have never seen it before, it doesn't look like any chocolate you know. But it gives a lovely smell of roses. It is even shaped in a form of the Julia Child Rose. But for some reason you feel suspicious. You ask a waiter to come, but instead get the manager himself. Confused you ask the manager to describe this unkown substance in your glass, but the Manager only nods and assures you that there is nothing to worry about. He when encourages you to proceed, and you in your bliss, innocense and unfortunate ignorance take a bite. At first, the taste feels acceptable, almost pleasant, but as you chew more, you realize something is wrong. It sticks to your throat and it is very hard to chew. It becomes difficult to breath, tears fill your eyes, and then finally in horror, you realize that you're chewing on a pile of♥♥♥♥♥♥ You attempt to spit it out, but manager just covers your mouth, and proceeds to shove more♥♥♥♥♥♥in your mouth. You try to fight back and finally push the man away only to see yourself covered in crap. As you angrily wipe yourself away, manager apologizes for his behavior and offers you water and sweet candies. But as you reach out for them, manager shoves a bucket of♥♥♥♥♥♥at you again. Angry and confused you shout at the manager, but instead of apology manager slaps you like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and tells you that you act lke an animal in his restaurant. After covering you in♥♥♥♥♥♥ humiliating you and ruining your blissful experience, he kicks you out. As you get up from the floor, the manager then in sweet voice tells you this:""You're always welcome to come back!""And shuts the door.This is my experience with GTA5. 444.5 hours.GTA5 Single Player: A masterpiece, it is alone worth the price.GTA5 Multiplayer: Stay away. It is designed for you to buy microtransactions. Not for fun. Every challenge, every mission, every ""profitable"" activity is designed in a way, that you have to face overwhelming odds, for a terrible reward. To acquire anything ""cool"" will require you hundreds of hours. The only reason I have most of the stuff is, because I got lucky with a modder throwing money at me. My other friend, who wasn't this fortunate is still struglling to get even half of what I have, yet played this game for almost 1000 hours. Which also brings another issue. Hackers/modders. For one good modder, you get 20 griefers. They will insta kill you, they will teleport you, they will ruin your missions. Report function doesn't work as Rockstar ignores you (also lately they started kicking even the innocent players). Modders do not get punished for months or at all. Every server with more than 10 players, has a 90% chance of having a modder.To those who are more into numbers. One of the most profitable businesses you can have in game is GunRunning.You need to periodically resupply your bunker, for workers to keep manufacturing your stock. It will take you 25.7 IN-GAME hours to gather maximum stock which will be worth 770.000$. If you decide to take risk and deliver it to a more distant location, you can get 1,155.000$. Once you start delivering, every player will be announced to your presence. They won't be limited to how they can engage you. They can take the most powerful planes, cars, weapons to destroy your shipment and receive a quick cash for ruining your shipment. If you kill them they lose nothing, if they kill you, you lose everything. You will have to restart your 25.7 hour session and hope that next time you will be more fortunate.So ask yourself this. Are you prepared to grind and risk losing everything to someone who has a better gear than you or just simply cheats? Most of you have limited time as it is. Do you really think it is worth it to spend your precious time on a game, which is designed to make you fail?Of course you can buy Shark Cards and they will give some cash. But here is the thing. The most expensive Shark Card in the game costs as much as the game. You get 8 million in game cash. Here is what you can buy.The cheapest bunker costs 1.165.000$ (needed to run GunRunning missions)That is without all facilities and functions.If we add them, you get the price of 2.860.000.That's without all the upgrades, to make you production faster (remember those 25.7 hours? You need 2 upgrades for that and 1 upgrade for security reasons)So total price will be:4.964.000$. Almost 5 million!You have 3 million remaining. You need an apartment for heists too. The cheapest one is 215.000$Ok, you also want to do CEO business? Ok.Here is the cheapest office.No upgrades:1.000.000$With upgrades:3.900.000$Oh I am sorry. Did I start losing your focus? It is boring reading all these numbers? Well if you're planning on buying this game and plan on investing time and money into GTA Online, get used to it. That's what you will be doing the entire time. GTA Online won't be your getaway game from work or school. It will be just another work.

"At first I was very skeptical of GTA. Played it a few times before and really couldn't get into it. But just bought it to give it another try. 14hrs so far, and plan on many more! With that being said it's a great way to play with friends and the only concern I have with it is all the loading (loading simulator?). Either way, 10/10",1.0
"If you want to play single player, yeah it's good. But multiplayer is the most trash ever. Loading takes about 10 minutes, you can't even do MP missions cause everyone leaves after 1 try, the only way to play them is to convince your friends to get the game too..",1.0
Can get banned for mods. Terrible loading times and horrible community.,0.0
"Runs like crap, full of bugs, the story is basically non-existent and the gameplay hasn't really evolved beyond fixing what was broken in other releases. There is a lack content on the single player-side which is odd considering this is supposed to be one of the best games ever. I should mention I have a top tier gaming laptop from 2015 which should be able to handle this game, and when it runs (the when is important) I get around 60-70 fps on maxed out settings; However it randomlly crashes with errors every 20min - hour. Rockstar Support is terrible and none responsve. If you want good writing, get the Witcher 3, if you want good gameplay get Saints Row, if you want satire get Fallout 3-4. If you want a game that mods well buy a Valve title. If you must buy GTA V get it on PS4. Also Open IV had nothing to do with online",0.0
"Hackers roaming free potentially getting unsuspecting players in hot waters was bad enough, but not to the point of ruining the whole thing.This move by Take-Two, however, might just be. I never modded the game myself, I am livid because of what this implies to the community as a whole, as well as to the creative freedom modding brings no matter which game it is for.Grand Theft Auto in particular is to be considered a sandbox game - which implies having fun however you see fit with few limitations. When you tear apart a tool like OpenIV and all projects which relied on it, you're saying players are only allowed to play with the toys that come with the sandbox. No bringing your own bucket and spade to play with, no no no. And it doesn't take a scientist to figure out that it is a lot of fun to introduce new content not only to GTA, but to any sandbox game. You ask me, T2 is interested in wiping out modding so that Rockstar's DLCs are the only novelties available - which of course you'll either grind or pay money for.Speculations aside, many already have expressed why this issue is so important, so not to sound like a broken record myself, this is where the discussion is:http://gtaforums.com/topic/889348-take-two-vs-modding/Edit: This news post (also in GTA Forums) was made and summarizes well the many pages of comments in the original thread above:http://gtaforums.com/topic/889557-the-people-vs-take-two-openiv-mod-shut-down/And because it seems kind of fitting:https://youtu.be/kcNI4D0K-zM",0.0

The customer support was horrible and the completley disregarded my request for information, I acknowledged the no appeal policy but simply asked why it happened.

U open your ports, set firewall rules, etc.... still no solution.- CheatersU encounter cheaters almost everyday. It's not unsuaI to have cheaters in online games but even a level 1,000 guy cheats. He would not risk his buildup character if rockstar was really capable of prevent cheating, right?- Bad Communityit all depends on who you meet. %95 of high-level players are toxic. They just wanna show off to newcomers. But when u meet some nice ppl, it's delightful.Everyone left the session during a fun time, then stuck in loading screen.

"looks like R* doesn't want to bring their games to PC in the future because they can't lock it down to their delight. Noone else is saying it so I'll say it: the campaign in GTA5 is GARBAGE!!! The multiplayer is a disaster of poor decisions (particularly in poor anticheat and microtransactions), the absolute contempt with which R* holds modders that want to improve the experience is disgusting, and back to that first point: THE STORY IS GARBAGE!!!!I know a lot of people enjoyed it, but I didn't, never even finished single player. Completely uninteresting characters (michael has a couple good moments and of course Franklin is likeable, but dull), by-the-numbers plot that doesn't engage me for anything aside from heists (few and far between), and of course that awesome ""emotional"" decision at the end to save trevor (unsympathetic psychopath) or Michael (person lost in suburban life) that failed to elicit any response from me (I watched a friend play the ending, it was lame), especially when you can save them BOTH!GTA5 is a parody of itself: they wanted to make it so big and grandiose seeming that they neglected to have good content or at least allow modders to fix it up. GTA was always about over-the-top narratives and silliness, but they did it to such an extent here that it's not actually entertaining anymore.  Never supporting this company again, they've lost it completely (and they like to abuse their developers too, great job R*)",1.0
"So as im writing this, I think I've racked up 130+ Hours in GTA V so far on my PC... yeah I KNOW!!!It's either too much, or not enough! ;)I held back my hype ALOT when the game was announced for the consoles... and even more when it was about to launch for PC... mainly well... i learned from Watch_Dogs, I know... different company... but still... hype is hype non the less. Now GTA V... well it didn't dissapoint ONE BIT, quite frankly now i own it on the PS4 as well, so yeah... the game is marvelous, the characters are well written, the story is amazing, and the ""character switching"" is well amazing.But enough about all that since, well like me, most of you watched the YouTube videos before PC launch.Now the game on PC runs VERY SMOOTH, (compared to GTA IV when it launched) so that was simply a joy to feel, watch and enjoy. The 60fps, the first person well the graphics, everything so far... is amazing to be honest.To sum it up... I gave into the hype, and I got swallowed whole, and I can admit... this game has not dissapointed.I mean come on... the detail that Rockstar has put into this... blows my mind, drive your car through Los Santos, park it in your garage, and listen to the engine cool off, sizzle, or hell even the AC cool off, depending on what type of car you drove. Things like that... simply are amazing and what make a game enjoyable. (At least for me)The Pros:+ Graphics+ Online Part + Heists+ Gameplay+ Story+ Lapdances ;)+ Characters (Franklin, Michael & Trevor)+ Mechanics (Car Modding, Activities etc. etc.)+ Smooth overall feel of the game, no crashes etc.+ Details Details Details honestly, i could list a crapton of stuff to put here.Now the cons:These cons, will only evolve around the Online Part of the game, since well honestly... i have yet to find  alot except 1 thing to stick my finger on when it comes to the Single Player part.Single Player:- No dating crazy women from the dating sites? :D i Remember that in GTA 4, was fun.- No increase in body mass when gaining strength, or for that part, the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional :( (Think of San Andreas, then you know what i mean)GTA Online- Not enough houses to purchase (High-End with heist rooms) i mean come ON we wanna be neighbours to the Playboy Mansion ;)- Stock Market disabled :( (Kinda hope to see that back / activated)- No increase in body mass when gaining strength, or for that part, the weight lifts at ""Venice Beach"" are non functional :( (Think of San Andreas, then you know what i mean)- The heists are fun, but loose re-play value once you do the Elite Challenges, i hope to see more Heists, either in Patch or DLC form.- No animals (well then again think they got removed to reduce lag etc. but still could be fun to go hunting with RPG's :P  )And honestly thats about it... its a honest review, with my own point of view... and ill say this... i will STILL give this a 10/10 why... simply because the game delivers to the hype it recieved... no questions about it.My Gaming/Work Rig:CPU: Intel i7 4770k clocked to 4.5GhzMotherboard: Asus ROG Maximus Hero VIIRam: 32GB DDR3 Kingston Beast 2400mhz RamHarddrives: 2x 256 Samsung SSD+ 2x 500GB Samsung SSD + 2TB 7200RPM External StorageGraphics Card: Asus Nvidia Titan 6GBMonitor: 2x Asus VG278HE 144hz Monitor",1.0
"Since this game is focused on the online stuff, this review will focus on said content. I have no problems with the single-player portion of this game, it's fun, replayable, and has multiple endings. On to the multiplayer:Pros:- You can create friends (or crew) only sessions to keep annoying people away- Content updates somewhat regularly- Decent character customization- Plenty of activties to do- Many properties to purchaseCons:- Pay to win- Mini transactions- Most properties have the same exact interior- Grinding is required to get anything cool- Heists are the only way to get decent money (which still isn't much)- Heists are more tedious than fun- Public online community is awful- Hackers galoreAll in all, I do like the Grand Theft Auto series, but as with a lot of games these days, corporate greed is number one priority for Rockstar.

"Grand Theft Auto V is a game that on the surface it looks amazing. But the moment from first getting the game and opening it you know you just made a huge mistake, today after a long absence from the game I decided to load into it too see how long it took to load into the game to see if it was still bad 12 minutes was the load into multiplayer and I personally find the single player garbage once you have played the story.  + Amazing story+ Huge world variety+ Lots to do (but not replay)- The world just doesn't feel as large  as it should, I don't know how to explain other than it just feels too small- The Multiplayer load times are absolutely ridiculous- 3rd party launcher (rockstar)- Heists while looking to be a ton of fun, have 0 replay value, I would go as far as saying they feel like an annoying grind after one playthrough- Hackers galore on multiplayer- While customer support being garbage doesn't seem like a big deal to me myself when looking at reviews on game hear me out on why it's a big deal in GTA V, You are bound to have problems in the game that you might want to contact customer support for, that's just because the game is buggy, and the support is garbage. Unlike Valve support which is apparently garbage I have never had to use it because everything on steam just runs quite good, GTA V is a complete opposite story.",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action-adventure video game with a single player and multiplayer mode. Sinlge player is great while multiplayer is terrible.At first I loved GTA online, it was fun and there so many new things to do but now online has gone downhill and by downhill I mean hackers keep playing and destroying the game while innocent players (like me) getting banned PERMANENTLY. in addition to all this, if you even try to contact R* support you will get nowhere. This leads me to my next point, R* support is the worst thing you will come across. There is no way you can unbanned if you try to contact them, here let me put it this way, trying to get unbanned via R* support is like trying not to encounter a modder/hacker in your lobby, it's impossible but possible.But minus modders/hackers and R* support, the game offers incredible things aswell. Sinlge player is such a great aspect of GTA it has an amazing campaign which goes on for so long, single player allows you add third-party mods which are stunning and fun at first until you log onto online and get banned. You have three main characters to control with different missions and backgrounds of their lives.Lastly, Online. GTA online is spectacular with friends because you can do races, heists and so much more, but if you have no friends who play online it can be a bit grindy trying to get the new cars and apartments which are extremely expensive like 2mill per car and up to 5mill for a CEO garage. since it can be a bit grindy and some people can be impatient, they all go to modders and ask for money, then all of a sudden money bags come raining from the sky and giving you like 2k per drop (do not ever pick up money bags) also the loading screens needs to improved, it takes like 2mins to be load into online. In online I had reached rank 153 I had everything and had done everything so I was usually mucking around in online or helping friends. But today I got an email saying I was permanently banned, I had no mods installed at all, not even in single player but as the tradition continues R* bans innocent players during the holidays.Overall Grand Theft Auto V is an amazing game for single player which has countless things you can do in it. On the other hand online needs to be improved like the banning, prices and loading screens.Single player: 8.5/10Online:6/10=14.5/20=72.5%",1.0
"Great game, Sometimes crashes but its GREAT!",1.0
"Don't buy this game until Rockstar gets off their asses and fixes the ridiculous amount of bugs they still haven't touched since launch.The game takes 12 hours to download on a good machine and crashes ten or twenty minutes for no reason. The online mode is full of hackers who kill everyone repeatedly and will even try to get you banned from the game by spawning you money. I don't have access to half of the map because the game will crash if you drive too far north.Don't bother reporting any bugs to Rockstar, they have some of the worst customer service I've ever seen. Take the crashes for example, I've seen hundreds of posts about this problem and Rockstar either ignores them or tells the poster to buy a better computer. This is obviously a huge problem that happens to many players and Rockstar hasn't even touched it yet.Don't get me wrong, this is a good game when it works, a really good game. But the fact that Rockstar has ignored so many game breaking issues experienced by such a huge portion of their fanbase makes me think that Rockstar just doesn't give two ♥♥♥♥♥.By the way, nice thing you pulled with the summer sale Rockstar!",0.0

"Of course a great game. And if it would not have all these annoying restrictions, cooldowns and the ability to go straight into a private friend only session, it would have been the perfect game.- When driving around in los santos, you get cursed at, at least twice every second. But trying to make a number plate with the same language is forbidden. That's just stupid and hypocritical.- For a game that is called: ""Grand theft auto"", you can only do a ""grand theft auto"" once a gameday, because of: restriction. God forbid you could make money easy with stealing cars; cus after earning billions, we need more of your money, so buy shark cards kid!- You can't do this or that, because there's a cooldown for 5, 10, 15, 30 minutes. For most things in online mode, you will have a cooldown timer which gets pretty annoying.- When alt-tabbing to google something, you get kicked within 2 minutes from a friends only session, where you are playing alone and put into a public zone. Stupid. First of all, why kick me in the first place, what is the reason for that, and why can't it remember i was in a friends only session?- When switching online characters, you get put in a public session; have to go back to story mode; then you can goto a friend only session. Which amounts to 3 to 4 minutes of useless loading the same♥♥♥♥♥♥again and again. - The interface is a pita; i'm aware that it's made for consoles, but couldn't they dedicate some time in the already long time it took to release it on the PC to make the interface a bit better for us PC players?  For instance, when you want to use a snack, you gotta go through 3 or 4 layers of this bloody menu, where it could have been tied to just one key.- The heist should have been do-able with only two players, and the other 1 or 2 optionally replaced with Ai. That way, you are not forced to play with idiots that leave after joining, dying or generally messing up the missions.- Now with the latest update, you are forced to play in a public session, which most of us are trying to avoid because it's just a deathmatch, filled with hackers and griefing idiots. It's just irritating.Even with all the irritations, the game is of course good. But to be honest, a game should not annoy or irritate you. After all, the sole reason we play games is to have fun.",1.0

I don't recommend this game, because GTA6 comming soon. It's a pity Rockstar, you almost reached passage threshold, still need a little bit improvement.

"I bought this game twice, both times the moment it released, and i can tell you this, online is a complete mess, grinding is way too long because they want you to buy the in-game currency, any method of fast farming is quickly removed, but to this day it takes ages to connect to a server, you get disconnected and i've lost items more times than i can remember, so you can clearly see where is their focus. The game itself crashes quite easily, you can't even alt-tab from it without getting a memory leak and honestly all their ""free"" DLCs are just scams to make you buy sharkcards, and now the worst of all, the one thing they couldn't touch, modding, they turned illegal the most essential mod of GTA, the one that allows you to add ANY other mod, OpenIV, so they basically just shot themselves in the foot, because the only true reason any of the GTAs ever lasted more than a year is because of modding. So with all this, NO you should not buy this, you should not support this company anymore, they are just another bunch of greedy ashls now, instead of buying this, go buy something from this very well known polish company, they actually deserve your money.Btw i'm sorry Take-two that you are only making billions of dollars because of us, ungrateful bstrds",0.0
"This game is amazing in every way except for Rockstar's inability to embrace the modding community.  Hate to break the news to you, but people kept playing your game because of mods, not because it's a good game.

It's just a broken piece of S**** game. Like alote of time nothing load in the game and don't get me started on the loading in GTA 5 it's just complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You just need to wait for like 15 min to maybe play online if the loading is too long you gotta (LOAD) to normal mode and then (LOAD) again for 5 min to play online. Then there's the heist. They are pretty fun and you get alote of money but nobody play heist anymore. Only the noobs are going to because they what money but they are not the best at the game. So during the heist you just want to stop and grab a bottle of the new savor of blench and drink it all. In conclusion don't buy this game if it's more than 25$.,1.0

"The game itself is fantastic, I have no complaints there. The problem is, Rockstar Social Club is a steaming pile of garbage. I've spent more time trying to fix connection issues, profile errors, corrupted saves, and general bs that shouldn't be a problem than I have actually playing this game. The internet is covered with people having the same issues as me, and Rockstar support has been pretty much nonexistent.

"I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign and the online mode, whilst becoming increasingly unfair to newbies with the ongoing inclusion of high-priced vehicles and weapons, was always a fond source of enjoyment over the years. However, after being hit by a suspension (for carduping), I then returned to play for 10 minutes with a newly refreshed character. Barely getting past the tutorial section I then get slapped with a permanent ban. What followed was months of trying to get through to Rockstar Support to try and get to the bottom of exactly why I was banned, and every time I get the same response. Trying to speak to someone about it is impossible, I always get the same standard response that I've been banned and that the decision can't be contested. I thought the suspension was harsh considering the amount of hackers that get away scot-free on a daily basis, but to be banned permanently for no discernable reason and to have followed that incident with the experience with Rockstar support means I really can't recommend this otherwise excellent game anymore.I hope one day I can play once again but I can't ever see that happening now. Very unfortunate.",1.0
"Okay so let me start with this. All of my reviews are positive beacuse i enjoy all of the games i review. I find it dumb and a waste of time to review something that i dont like. So Grand Theft Auto V. The game is great. Lets start with the single player. The story is amazing one of the best from the game franchise. I like the idea of having more than 1 playable character like it used to. Graphics are good (i mean it depends on your pc most of the time but whatever.) Controls are okay on a keyboard. In my opinion everything is good when it comes to controls but the flying is awful. When you fly a helicopter for example you need to use WASD and the numpad sometimes the mouse to shoot. Its just horrible. Anyway even if you finished the game there is a lot to do. Lots of side quests, collectible items, cars, guns etc. to get. So i guess lets talk about why anyone would buy this now really the online part. To be honest im a bit dissapointed. The online is alright but i found a couple of issues. Sometimes its the game's fault sometimes the other player's fault. The pointless,dumb killings happen just beacuse i guy has a jet or a tank. Another problem is the modder issue. People keep crying if there are modders on so they could get money its laughable and sad. Thats not even the worst. The fact that you can get banned for getting from a modder (even though you didnt ask for it) is unacceptable. So if you would get money from a modder just spend it immediately. You might ask what issue did i run into that was the game's fault. Well its simple. Some of the missions are just full of bugs. I found most of the bugs in heist setups. So can i recommend this game. Again i only make a review if its a yes so ye. The game is enjoyable in singleplayer. The online part is fun with friends. But one more thought i suggest buying this on sale. It's a lot more worth it that way. Touka out.",1.0

"Graphics are great, the idea is great, implementation is flawed. I've bought this game three times PS3, PS4, and now PC. I kind of regret that, even though the PC version is by far the best.First off, the pricing model is horrible if you're not the type of person to regularly play this game and have millions saved up because you've already bought everything you want. I usually play for a week or two when new DLC comes out, so that means I have to grind to be able to afford even a fraction of what's in the DLC. By the time I can afford to enjoy the new DLC, I'm already over playing the game for the time being. This is to encourage you to buy Shark Cards, which give a pretty bad return relative to how much real life money they cost.My second problem ties in to the first. If you do want to grind, it's not very user friendly. Loading screens are too long, and occasionally it'll drop you into someone else's missions even if you're the host of your own. It's happened before that me and two other friends would be doing missions, finishing quickly because we know what we're doing, and when we're going on to another mission it'll take all three of us and put us in one guys game, taking host away from me. This is ridiculous. I can't recommend this because that would tell Rockstar that it's okay to release an incomplete game three times. They've done amazing stuff with the graphics and the attention to detail, but the multiplayer aspect of the game is very basic and very shallow.",1.0

"I'M SURE A LOT OF US CAN RELATE TO THIS:First off, GTA has turned from this really fun free roam city game where you would go and kill other players and rob cars and sotres and do things that were actually possible and it was nice but now every update that seems to come out is nothing but military vehicles or just really rediculous things. now it's all about who can blow you up first. like that orbital strike that costs $500,000 for a manual shot and $750,000 for an auto matic targeting.... like WTF ROCKSTAR!!! do you think money grows on tree's??? all these new cars and choppers and things cost millions of dollars and your heists don't even give us this type of money and shark cards are so damn expensive and then you wonder why people are modding the game to give themselves wods of cash. my negative review isn't even because of any of this. it's because i was banned for ""Modding"" or what ever it was. Yes i am definitely guilty of being in a modded lobby and wanting money one time. i was banned for a week and i accepted it and moved on but then the other time i just happened to find myself in a lobby with a player who was teleporting to players and sticking himself to them and giving them money. myself included and then i was once again banned... this time for a month even though this situation was not my fault. the last ban i recieved... i don't even know why or how i got it. i was completely broke and haven't been on GTA for a while and i only got online a few times to check out the update and then i was banned PERMANENTLY... i spent $60 on this game and it seriously pisses me off that i spent my oney on this piece of♥♥♥♥♥♥and can't even play it or even try to send a ticket to get my account back online. this is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.

"I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND GTA V or GTA ONLINE!!!!   I like many others have had my account mistakingly suspended and reset recently due to a new anticheat script used by Rockstar.  This is leading to the banning of innocent players with no reversal appeal, follow up investigation or notice to the player of the offense.I've been playing Grand Theft Auto Online legit since GTA IV in 2008, I have over 600 hrs of gametime if you include my time on Xbox One.  I loved the whole series since top down.    But in 3D GTA the pay2play is top of the line.  Shark cards really leave you feeling like you were just taken by a shark.  I've spent more money on this game than I'd care to admit.  But I never cared to cheat, hack, mod, whatever.  I played the game legit with my friends and just dabbled time to time after no one played anymore. Now I can't trust Rockstar at all... because I don't harrass other players or even play with old friends, just by myself every once in a while, but now I'm banned for some mysterious offense without justification or human attention to the situation.  When requesting an explanation I like everyone else with this problem have been met with an automated reply: ""Hello SensiSoulja,Thank you for contacting Rockstar Support. GTA Online bans are triggered by a number of factors, including modding in GTA Online, exploiting or abusing game mechanics, manipulating protected game data and code, or otherwise interfering with other players’ gameplay experience.All GTA Online suspension and banning decisions are final and may not be appealed.

But this time it says I have been suspended til July 1, 2018, if and when I come back my account will be reset... I don't know what happened, but I don't mod, hack, or do any other nefarious activities online at all.   After doing some research I find out apparently there is a newly implemented Anticheat program that they claim is very accurate at detecting hackers, modders, manipulators, and harrassers.  Plenty of posts and videos have been put up on social media about people getting there accounts suspended and wiped, or banned by mistake, with zero appeal policy and no investigations or follow ups.

Thanks Rockstar ( No I Haven't Been banned )  - Shark Cash Cards, are you thirsty R*? If someone plays hard and gets a crap ton of money and doesn't buy your cards you ban them? Are you having fun in there little w*nkers?  - Online community can be very toxic ( but also can be very friendly, just find the right people or just play with friends )  - By now the game should be worth 49,99€ and not 59,99€ because it's getting worse!  - Customer support sucks! A LOT!  - R* has a thing where they don't like to reply or read most if not all the tickets by the time you read this!  - R* gives so many Copy-Paste answers that it is disgusting already! WE buy your games, respect us or you will go from rich to broke soon!  - There are so many cons if you think about it well, that's why I say the game price should be reduced and the R* employees should work harder, or at least work to try to help their customers!",1.0

"If you wanted a review you came to the wrong place, here is instructions on how to cook a turkeyNow, we know that many people have strong opinions on the best way to cook a turkey. You may fry it, grill it, roast it overnight, or even cook it in a slow cooker. You may brine religiously every year, or maybe have a secret family spice rub that only gets used at Thanksgiving.But just to keep things really simple and straightforward with this tutorial, today we are taking a completely no-frills approach — though there are lots of places along the way where you can add some spice, extra flavor, or personal touches.Consider this a recipe template and feel free to play with it as much or as little as you like; our goal is simply to give you a foolproof way to get that turkey roasted and onto plates with as little stress as possible.This method will work with any turkey: big or small, brined or not, free-range or otherwise. Cooking times will vary, but the basic technique will be the same. For reference, the turkey in the photos was a pre-brined 16-pound turkey from Williams-Sonoma.(Image credit: Emma Christensen)How to Safely Thaw the TurkeyFor this method, be sure to let your turkey completely thaw before cooking. If it was frozen through when you bought it, the turkey will thaw within a few days in the fridge, approximately 24 hours for every five pounds of turkey. For quicker thawing, place the turkey in a cold water bath and change the water every 30 minutes until it's thawed.For more information on safe turkey thawing, check out the USDA website and our detailed turkey thawing instructions:How To Safely Thaw a TurkeyTurkey Basics: Safe Thawing from the USDAHow to Roast a Frozen TurkeyHowever, if your turkey isn't completely thawed yet — no worries! You can roast your frozen turkey and it will turn out just fine! If your turkey is still frozen — fully or partially — just hop on over to our frozen turkey tutorial and follow the instructions. You'll be fine (and your gravy will be even more delicious).How To Cook a Frozen Turkey(Image credit: Emma Christensen)(Image credit: Emma Christensen)How to Brine a TurkeyOne thing we're not talking about here is brining the turkey. This method has become popular over the last few years and involves immersing the turkey in a salt-water solution or dry-brining in salt for a day or so before cooking. The end result of this process is moist, perfectly seasoned white and dark meat. We've had great results with brining and heartily endorse it. If you want to brine, great! If you don't, our method here will still work perfectly.For more details on how to brine your own turkey, check out these posts:All About BriningHow To Brine a TurkeyHow To Dry-Brine a TurkeyThe Best Place to Brine Your Thanksgiving Turkey is In Your Refrigerator DrawerCarving the TurkeyCarving a turkey is just like carving an extra-large chicken. Make sure your chef's knife is sharp and then go for it. Remove the wings first, and then the thighs — pop out the joints that keep these pieces attached to the bird and cut straight through the joint. When carving the beast meat, slice close to the rib cage with the flat of your knife right up against the rib bones. Once you have the meat off, you can separate the thighs into thighs and drumsticks, and carve the breast meat into individual slices.Cooking a Thanksgiving TurkeyAre you ready? Let's cook some turkey! If you get anxious during roasting, just remember that roasting a turkey is just like roasting a large chicken. The same methods and ideas apply. Even if you don't get fancy with spices or brining or special basting liquids, your turkey will still turn out browned, moist, and flavorful.your welcome.",1.0

"April 14, day when I quit my job, April 14, day when GTA 5 was released for real xDApril 14, day when I stop having xXx <3 with my wife, couse game have so much thrill !Ok now about review :Grand Theft Auto V is a spectacular third person free roaming game which does well in portraying everyone's guilty pleasures, whether that is slaughtering innocents, exploding cop cars with RPGs, murdering hookers or taking a trip to the local strip club. Grand Theft Auto has always been amongst the greatest free-roam shooters of all time, and it continues that legacy here with GTA V. The online experience and racing have been greatly improved and the story features three playable protagonists rather than the traditional one.In the story of Grand Theft Auto V, you play as three very different characters, with three different, distinctive personalities. First is Michael, a retiree from the illegitimate business of bank robbing and a family man with tons of family problems. Next is the young blood, Franklin. Straight outta the hood and looking to make a living without having to look over his shoulder every step of the way. Lastly is Trevor, the truly psychotic man with no regards for human life. Everyone that plays GTA V instinctively chooses a favorite character, whether it is Michael, because you want to see him get his family back on track, Franklin, because you want to see him create a future for himself, or Trevor, because you too enjoy killing drunken rednecks. Regardless you must play as all three, and the greatest feature that separates the campaign of Grand Theft Auto V from all others is the bank heists. Plan and execute heists, whether you choose stealthy or an all out blood bath, choose your crew which ultimately decides the payout you receive from each heist and enjoy every detail and heist you can. The story is well worth the price of buying the game, but it comes with an added bonus. GTA Online.Although GTA Online had a rocky start with several issues, it is for the most part fixed today, and a very fun experience to play with friends. In the beginning their were terrible servers, problems involving created characters being deleted and now the mission payouts being much lower than early release, and replaying them pays out even less. Along with most others, I am still awaiting for heists in multiplayer, which very well may never come, but regardless GTA Online is still fun. You still have the ability to run around and kill others, as well as civilians, but instead of that simplicity, you can now customize your character, his vehicles, and even where he lives. You earn money through online missions and other methods that helps you pay for newer vehicles, apartments, weapons and clothes. You create your own character and literally choose his skills, which you can later improve.Grand Theft Auto always has great replay value, gamers still play San Andreas and GTA IV, and of course, several thousand still play GTA V. After the story is over, you can always free roam, and when you get tired of wandering aimlessly, the multiplayer is great to play for long periods of time. Gain satisfaction improving your vehicles and purchasing a high end apartment. I only have one little note about this game, NOT FOR KIDS. Seriously, if you are even the least bit immature, or offended by violence, language or sexual content, please do not buy this game, and don't buy it for kids either. A great game but it's worth waiting for, especially if it will traumatize you, or turn you from innocent, into a kid that spews foul language.Overall a masterpiece.

"The story mode is really good and there's tons of fun to be had in this one. But GTA Online just isn't as great as it used to be.While it was really great fun in the beginning, Rockstar's over-reliance on microtransactions interfered with the design elements of it. The entire point of Online is to be richer than everyone else, and show how rich you are to everyone else, which won't matter anyway what with how rich kids can simply use real money to bypass the grind, or other not so rich kids use hacking to get by.It's come to a point where almost all the good stuff is too expensive to afford without literal weeks of grinding, and there's only so many times I'd want to play the same missions again and again, whilst avoiding hackers.",1.0

"372 Hours spent playing this game and I can tell you this: Don't waste your time. Current PR issues aside, here's what it comes down to: GTA V single player is great. GTAO spits in the face of every pereson who was unfortunate enough to give rockstar their money. My biggest gripes are: -No dlc makes it over to single player. -Purchases in SP cost pennies but in GTAO the same purchase can cost millions-Online currency, while not impossible to make, is very scarce (they do this to encourage microtansactions)-Hiest matchmaking is a joke. You either wait 2 hours or join a quick match and wind up with idiots who die twice and then quit leaving you stuck for another 30 minutes.This game would be a great free game for someone but it isn't worth what anyonew is gonna pay for it in it's present state",1.0

You know, GTA things.I was racing down the road towards the objective and..Got banned. Permanently this time.Again, no recourse. No assistance. Nothing.70 canada bucks down the drain.

"I have never play an awesome game like this one,  it's been a while since I play a game with a really storyline and this bring you 3 stories that are connected,  a lot more of possibilities to explore,  and a diversity in vehicles and clothing so you can personalise your characters even more",1.0
"This is one of the most impressive games I've ever played.It is the definitive GTA game, with jaw dropping scope that is executed in such a polished way that you'd think Nintendo made this (though the memory leak issue that was present during the first few days was not great).There's so much I could say about this game, but instead of reading this you should just buy it.It's incredible, it really is.",1.0
"All of the games content is online and the only way to get it is to grind for the rest of your natural life doing the same missions 10,000 times and even thats not enough to have everything you want. I'm not kidding you. To have it all you need well over 100 million dollars but the avrage mission pays out 6-12k. Do the math on that. 10,000 / 100,000,000 Whats the total?The only other option is to buy overpriced shark cards. And then when you DO have a lot of money, they sweep your account, ban you for cheating and then you have to start over. The players are rude and constantly attack you. You dont even want to try to make a friend cause there is a 99.9999% chance if he see's you he will shoot at you, or run you over, or blow up your car. Thers no point in even having a nice car because you cant get 3 blocks down the road before its riddled in bullet holes and shattered windows because every player has to shoot at you. The only other option is to go into passive mode which renders your guy useless as he cant do a dam thing but stand there with his thumb up his.... This is the worst online experience in existance... I can go on for days with why this game sucks but I wont waste another second of my life on this hunk of crap. I only wrote this reveiw in hopes of saving some new commer from thinking this game will be a fun one time purchase. This is a $60.00 Pay to Win  MMO game that penalizes you for success and hackers and cheaters run rammit though the game. Half the players are cheating. The other half is running from the cheaters who spam lobbys with glitched items to lag everyone out or crash your game or go into god mode and shoot everyone in site with aim-bot miniguns.Rockstar made this game undesireable. The players made the game unplayable. Together they create the most hostile, and unfriendly online experience of all time.You can play the single player once, and its fun. But its only fun once. After you beat the game you have 20 million or so and not one single thing to buy... Because as I said in the beguning of post. ALL of the games REAL content is online.Let me give you an idea of what I mean.With the 3 main guys you can buy all the shirts and pants and hats with about 2,000.00 because thers only like 12 options for each guy. But with the online mode. there is literally 100's of clothing items to choose from, and dont even get me started with the cars... Make no mistake, GTA5 is an Online game.",0.0

"Pros:+ GTA V. It's everything that is Grand Theft Auto. It has evolved into a more serious, beefy mass, that it is now.+ Graphics+ Vehicles, weapons, car mods, clothing items, Customization. Bicycles are back.+ Singeplayer story and characters+ First Person Shooting and Driving+ Map diversity+ Switching between characters+ Mini games! + Driving has a better feel both on and off-road, even if just a bit+ Business owning+ There's a wide selection of radio stations/music from the time it took place+ Custom music folder+ You can swim underwater and explore just about anything you want+ GTA Online and synching is better. Easier to play with friends/others without so much difficulty.+ Own your own house/apartment/garage/gear/bikes/cars/etc online+ Even more customizations for the above that exist only in the online mode+ Free DLC+ Updates+ Random events across the open world. Witnessed a care pile up on the freeway. Police chases and shootouts. Robberies. Fights.- GTA Online still a **** fest. If you don't have a friend or group to play with online in a friends only session, you will probably enjoy singleplayer better. - Online missions/heists. Poor sports, hosts, and personalities make finishing anything very difficult. - Cheaters****- Spawn killers/stalkers- Rambos- The amount of **** talking in every language imagineable and by every age imagineable. Some of the worst life forms exist in this game online. However, I've seen worse.- Cops are still a bit OP/cheaty at times and other times ridiculously dumb- Needs more places to go inside of. No more Cluckin' Bell robbing sprees.- Car handling still could be better. Mainly the collisions and weird orbiting that some cars do kind of ruins the immersion.- Stock market. It's useful to get huge amounts of cash in singeplayer mode. Online, it is pretty useless since the data/graphs shown are not accurate and do not work properly as is in singleplayer too.- Matchmaking still blows donky balls. - Online Personal Radars. The fact that people can see you on the radar without visually seeing you is pretty lame.- Lack of joystick support. Game only supports X-Box controller and similar gamepads. Must go through a few hoops to get a joystick working. Currently using Logitech Extreme 3d pro after having to run a program to trick the game into thinking it's an xbox controller. Come on guys. For the PC. Xbox controller support only? Really? Nahhh. - Can't create custom character that can exist in singleplayer. You can use your custom online character and play ""offline mode"", but you can't do or go to places you could in singleplayer. You also can't set your default online mode to friends only session, private session, or offline mode.Singleplayer is where the fun is at unless you have a friend or two to jump into a friends only/private session of your own and experience. I'd say online wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for cheating in every session and if not cheating, the horrible personalities that you come across in heists that make it near to impossible to play.With all of the cons and poor online play, I still recommend this game fully. Why? Because it is still incredibly fun. However, not online, unless you're with some friends.",0.0

"While I greatly enjoyed the singleplayer to GTAV, I've always found the multiplayer incredibly distasteful. Not just because its full of microtransactions and what are functionally paywalls, but also because of how the higher-ups group the community into aquatic animal groups based on spending habits, with ""whales"" being big spenders. That by itself is more than a tiny bit uncomfortable, but compounding this are the spoken beliefs of the CEO of Take-Two that they are currently not doing enough to monetize GTA Online (despite having made over 700 million dollars in the 2016-2017 fiscal cycle), which is patently ridculous and insulting. What has finally tipped me over the edge is the decision by Take-Two (not Rockstar, who have consistently supported and encouraged the modding scene around their games), to file a cease-and-desist against a modding team who went nonsensically out of their way to ensure that Take-Two and Rockstar's IP and code were protected. To declare modding illegal is untennable and frankly disgusting, made worse only by the fact that Take-Two are literally alone in going this far. This (hopefully) isn't the sign of an industry shift, just a classic case of a games company trodding on consumers for no real reason. GTA Online made me dissapointed, but not upset enough to downvote the game as a whole, because the singleplayer is good, but this recent incident has put me over the edge. Don't support Take-Two and their decision, so don't buy this game.",1.0

"To start with I'll say the only reason I'm not recommending this game right now is because it crashes consistently on Windows 10. Otherwise it's a great game and I suggest picking it up once Rockstar gets off their asses and fixes this. I'll also update my review at that point too.The game starts and runs really well, but will eventually crash within 5-30 mins. I've tried compatibility mode for Win7 and Win8, and running as admin with and without compatibility. The bigger issue is Rockstar's response to this problem is that they don't support Win10 and to roll back your OS. Now I agree installing to a brand new OS on release isn't a great idea, but the preview ISO was available for nearly half a year, and all my other games run fine on Win10.

"Rockstar is stupid, they really think banning people is gonna stop modding when people who mod are usually nice. Everytime they waste their time making anti-cheat stuff, when everyone finds a way around it. And Rockstar just makes things too expensive and expect people to buy their Sharkcards, which is the main reason why there are so many modders. Yes, the heists are fun, but it's the only ""fun"" way of getting money, and it seems like they don't even listen to their fans. And yes, they did a good job on the game itself, but it's like they don't even care about their fans and see why people are modding for the most obvious reason. Modding is the only other way to make GTA fun, since there are only so many things you can do but all the stuff you can do only gives out about 150 hrs, which makes the game more dissappointing. They need to change their sense of mind and understand that people mod so they can have anyone else have fun since this game is mostly money farming simulator 2015.",1.0

"I've paid my hard earned dollar for this game a good three times now. All it's become is more of a money grind for the online, a short while of trying to tear down mods, the reason I bought the PC version to begin with, and then their most recent stunt of ban everything influenced by modders or hackers.The game itself is fine, and I'll gladly let the singleplayer speak for itself. However, a lot of the focus of paying for this version of the game personally was multiplayer. I didn't have to pay for some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t subscription just to play online on PC, and that was great! Now I'm afraid to go online, lest I get my character that I've only just started to get good stuff on wiped. For all I know, they wiped the character anyway. Rockstar has a LOT of angry people to face, and I think just an in-game currency boost won't do it this time. You've lost trust, and it is not going to be easy to regain that. Good luck selling RDR2 to some of the people from this leg of the community. Doubt it'll sell until something is done here.Long term edit: And just recently, even when I go to play singleplayer, it would seem some update somewhere along the way ♥♥♥♥ed up performance. The game has become completely unplayable.",1.0
"I got to say, this is my first GTA game, so I had a lot of expectations that needed to be met in order for me to like this game, but I can't really compare it to previous games, all my expectations were from hearsay. I got this game when it first came out, but due to finals, I wasn't able to play it that much until May. I've since put 144 hours into this game, the most I have done with any game that I own on Steam, in that month, and all that time has been in multiplayer, I haven't even touched the singleplayer. This game is so good, that my dad, who pretty much only plays WoW, saw me playing this, and decided to get this game and has loved it.It would take me too long to describe the pros for this game so here are the cons:- I have had issues with my latest driver (GeFore 980) and this game which has caused me to crash multiple times. However, its a simple fix, all I have to do is go and instal the 347.86 driver. (I haven't fully tested this out, but I think the problem was when I had NVAA running, I'll be sure to edit this to see if it works out)- It can take you a while to get some of the more expensive objects such as vehicles or appartments, but if you do heists and missions, you can get that money in a surprisingly quick time while still having a blast- If you don't have 3 other friends to do heists, you will be waiting for randoms to join your game. However, the wait time has decreased significantly since the game first came out. Now, you might only have to wait 3 minutes, but there is a good chance that it will be full sooner than that.- there is no way for you to give money to your friends, but that is understandable because that is how the hackers were able to give sooo much money so it's understandable whyOn the note of hackers: are there hackers? yes. Do you see them frequently? More often than not, you don't, but you can from time to time. Are the hackers a bad thing? Absolutely not. They don't ruin the gameplay at all BECAUSE:1. If they decide to be♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and start killing you, you just go into passive mode and they can't do anything to you.2. If you don't feel like going into passive mode, you can always join another server that won't have one, and it is as if nothing ever happened.3. Half the time, you can get money from them because most of them are nice.4. They turn the crazyness of GTA Online from 10 to 11. There have been times where there were UFO saucers in the middle of downtown Los Santos blowing people up and my only reaction was laughing because I just got blown up by a god damn UFO xDOverall, I got to say, this game is amazing. I know that some of the cons may seem really outstanding, but that's because I haven't listed the awesomeness and hilarity of this game. It is absolutely normal to be driving down the street, crash into a NPC car, get mad at it, shoot the driver, start going on a rampage (because ♥♥♥♥ it, why not?), accidentally shoot a player (by accident, I mean that it was unfortunate that the player had to cross paths with you during your rampage so now they must die), they get mad, they call in a helicopter, they start shooting at you with missiles and machine guns, and then the next thing you know, the entire server is fighting each other. In downtown Los Santos. With so many cops shooting at anyone and everyone that you would have thought that the national guard was being called in. All because you were doing 100 in downtown and got mad that you lost control of your car and slammed into a NPC.",1.0

"Something I can't stress enough, if a game is already two years old it should not be the price of a new game.You can say ""Online gets free updates all the time"" but in truth you'll find that these updates of ""FREE"" new content is nearly always going to require either 30-40+ hours of purely farming ingame money non-stop for a small portion of the actual update or spending ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of actually earned money in order to see what SOME of the content from these so-called free DLC's have to offer. TL;DR ~ 40+ hours of your life grinding away nonstop, or more than $200 for the most recent Gunrunning DLC  going the cheapest, non-upgrading route, meaning: no weapon upgrades, no spending on research, no alternate vehicle upgrades, cheapest bunker w/ no upgrades, cheapest Mobile Operation Center truck (Which does include vehicle and weapon workshops along with command center, although being redundant in this case) Let's take the most recent Gunrunners update as an example: $14,670,000 is the total cost of most vehicles with no upgrades, cheapest bunker with no upgrades (No production upgrades, no security, no personal quarters, no transportation, no gunrange, just the base setup) the mobile operation center w/ the cheapest truck, the vehicle and weapon workshop, and command center (This does not include clothing with the exception of the Ballistic Equipment, or weapon upgrades and the research required to retrieve them, or the modifications to vehicles or research also required for them) $14,670,000 is equivelant to, if going purely on the idea that you already are capable of being a VIP which now requires you to have $50,000 in the bank at any time, $200 i.e. 2 Megalodon Shark Cards will be required. Now if you wanted to do this legitlimately on the basis that you already own a decent money making building say for instance a car warehouse and let's just, although this is nigh impossible, say you have all the Top Grade vehicles to sell, always paying the $20,000 to take it to the specialist dealer, netting you $80,000 each time and this is to assume that you somehow never damage the vehicles you deliver. Say it somehow takes you 5 minutes to deliver, a MANDATORY waiting period of approximately 16 minutes, and restocking let's say takes 8 minutes and we'll say you immediately begin restocking so as to remove 8 minutes from the 16 minute waiting time, and we'll also say you always get back a top range vehicle. So that's 14,670,000/80,000 which is 183.375. Multiply that by the minutes you have: 13 and you get around 2383 minutes or rounded up to about 40 hours of purely vehicle work non-stop (And once more this is purely assuming that you gather the vehicles without taking any losses, which is almost entirely impossible, and always taking only 8 minutes to get a new vehicle and not damaging it, again being almost impossible, always getting top-tier vehicles, and never losing any cash when delivering vehicles aswell as always delivering in 5 minutes.)So in truth, a very small portion of one of the most recent ""FREE"" DLC's is equivelant to approximately more than 40 hours of your life purely grinding away, or around $200 if you pay for it. How's that for FREE? How great of Rockstar to give us all this FREE content, right?I'm ♥♥♥♥ing done.",1.0

"A rare, but fantastic, port from Rockstar. The development team have clearly learned that the PC community won't be satisfied with copypasta garbage (*Cough* GTA IV *cough) and, as a result, have come out with a highly optimised game that can truly be considered the ""difinitive"" version.Hopefully soon, those guys on GTAForums or whoever will be able to crack and modify the game folders they can, currently, only see through OpenIV. The modding potential for this game is enormous... It's just a shame that Rockstar didn't embrace this idea as openly as, say, Bethesda with Skyrim and the like.If you can run it (and you porbably can), buy it. This is one of the best open world games ever created and you'd be doing youself a disservice not to have it on your hard drive.",1.0
"Single player is a masterpiece and the game is well worth getting for that alone during a sale!  However multi still has endless loading screens and is rife with hackers, issues that have persisted since the console launch, nearly 5 years ago! 3 out of 5 games you play will have a hacker. The brazen nature of their hacking seems to suggest that R* isn't doing much regarding banning them. On top of this the community is incredibly toxic and makes playing thoroughly unpleasant. Also, everything is geared towards getting you to pay for the in-game money though the not-so-micro transactions or face a gruelling grind putting up with obnoxiously kids who are too young for the game and hackers spoiling that process. The online was amazing when it fist arrived (and worked) on both console and PC but now is honestly something you can pass up if you aren't desperate.  As said before, single player is great though!",1.0

"I have fun only because of the cars. Some sound better than Forza  games. But no way to test drive them or hear the sound outside of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ youtubers that won't stop talking. Now lets get to the game. Every feature in MP that was exploited they just remove instead of trying to patch. Giving money. Mechanic driving car to you vs teleporting it in. Apparently even the armored cars in freeplay are gone now. Only way to find them is if you had an old character that had them unlocked.Game is such BS with the anticheat too. I've personally had a car, with no visible player in it, following me around. Suddenly I start exploding out of nowhere. Try to kill the car, nothing happens. I get TP'd to fort zancudo, suddenly the car is behind me. I end up driving away at one point and I get flung into the air completely controlled by said ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Now I get blamed for hacking as it's in clear view of all the other players.Oh, and how unfair the game is to new people. It has BS weapons like the minigun that players just use whenever because it takes no skill to spray rounds with it. Higher level unlock of course. Now couple that with the FACT, that higher levels have access to better armor, AND, as you level up your health permanently increases. How the ♥♥♥♥ is that a feature? I have shot these minigun douches in the head because some of them suck, but they survived it because they are max level and have more base health than me.This ♥♥♥♥ing game...OH OH OH, just remembered something real good that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Rockstar pulled. The past TWO times before this last event where you ""buy shark cards and get x amount of money back"" they never gave people money. The last two times before now, you buya  shark card and 2x the money, as in you buy a 3mil card, you get another 3mil free. I would say a large majority never got that money. Now this last time of course it was only 30% of what you paid for, so of course they gave that out. ♥♥♥♥ing cheapskates. NEWEST EDIT:So apparently all the money they scammed off people and earned isn't enough. So they shut down OpenIV which has nothing to do with their multiplayer, so they can force all the users to the MP. Maybe if they'd release singleplayer DLC and make the endgame not suck♥♥♥♥♥ they'd get the money they want. I'd literally pay if they implemented lspdfr into the game.

"At first it was great. Single player was perfect. Everyone was having fun.Then they released a patch that ♥♥♥♥ed up the FPS. Online was decent. Everyone was still having fun.Then they added more and more DLC. Single player was alright. Online was Pacific Standard. Everyone was grinding.Then they added the overpriced offices/yachts/recycled warehouses with their useless customization. Single player was forgotten. Online was shark cards. Everyone was bored.This continued for the past year with more and more useless events that didn't pay enough, more and more money wasting products that were forgotten in 2 weeks and less and less players to play Online with.This was all because of how much money R* was making with the Shark Card microtransactions.You pay like 75 euros and get 8 million in GTA Online. Those 8 mil can get you 2 Pegasus vehicles, 4 cars and clothes that you will never use again.Problem is, if you really wanted to get lots of money in Online, you could just ask someone with cheats to drop you like 50 million or even do it yourself with another copy of GTA 5.R* doesn't like people circumventing their microtransaction system, so instead of going after those who create the cheats  and use them (which there were plenty of), they went for the shortcut and shut down the entire modding scene, including the single player modders(which there were way more of than in Online). A large selling point of GTA 5 on PC was mods. And now that selling point is gone.I will not be buying anything from them ever again and I hope that you won't be too.Good job ♥♥♥♥♥tar.",1.0

"I got this game back on the 360 in 2013 when it came out,  and I had hours dedicated to Online.

I had a two level 100+ characters on the 360 version with around 3 mil on both accounts.  But one day I got banned for no reason.  Coming back to GTA Online now, nothing much has changed,  but just a lot of content Ive missed out on. Reading reviews on how innocent players who dedicated hundreds,  or thousands of hours in Online just to see that progress crumble down, it's unfortunate. This game is fun but it has its downsides.  Quite a lot more than asked.  My only real problem is on stunt races. Quite a handful of them,  it freezes.  Other than that.  Its a mixed game.

"I got banned without any explanation. In this game I cannot just pick another server and continue playing while I banned on the first one. This is same as taking the game I bought from me and I don't even know why. Rockstar Games isn't some new small amateur company and GTAV isn't some free to play homebrew PSP game. I bought it here on Steam, I payed full price, which isn't on the low end. I've spent time lvl'ing, completing heists with my friends (BTW this darn matchmaking and loading times - that's another horror story). Now R* removes mine and my friend's progress, because banning us for a month without explaining the reason isn't enough apparently. The launcher says I can still play offline... Yeah, right, imagine playing something like Counter-Strike 1.6 offline with bots after getting banned online - this looks like a mockery. Yes, there're lots of dishonest modders playing your game, they have an ability to give bags of cash to ANYONE, EVEN PEOPLE THEY DON'T KNOW. THIS SITUATION HAPPENS TO YOU = THE GAME YOU BOUGHT FOR FULL PRICE IS NO LONGER YOURS. All these modders is your problem, R*, not your client's. And I'm feeling scammed now. This money I payed for your game I really enjoyed, just like all your previous games, it's nothing compared to the respect for your company you've lost.

I will start with the single player. If you are someone who want's to buy GTA 5 as you like to play story games then it is a good buy. GTA has a very good story line with good twists throughout the story that will keep you interested in the game and the characters you meet along the way are very good. The NPC's can get annoying but its all part of the fun of driving around Los Santos trying to kill someone when all of a sudden an NPC drives into you.Multiplayer feels like a separate game in some perspectives as you can go through the story line of the heists that progressively get you more and more money as you continue through each one. There are many good game modes to weather you want to do ridiculous races as you do loops over the Alamo sea or jump from rooftop to rooftop or if racing isn't your thing you can go into death matches as you fight in teams or by yourself trying to win each round. The community made jobs are also very good and I would recommend playing Snipers VS Stunters as it is a good mix of both accuracy and skill or give it a go and create your own.Pro's and Con's of the game (Broken down the passage incase you want a shorter list to look at)Pro's+Great story+Great characters to play as+You can meet some interesting NPC's and it is also got a very good plot line+A very well made open world map+Very good graphic's (If your PC has the specs required)+You can toggle between first and third person gameplay+45-50+ hours of story mode if you plan on ignoring most side missions+Good replay value+You can get 100+ hours out of multiplayer easily+Wide range of Cars and wide range of music to listen in said cars+Superb video capture and editing featuresCon's- Has started to become more and more pay to win due to the price of items in multiplayer- Can meet a lot of Toxic players- Filled with cheaters now- Sometimes you will meet people who just want to ruin your fun (Not Rockstar's fault tho)- Reporting someone tends to be useless 99% of the time as nothing is ever done- Little exclusive content,1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V has a hollow and unappealing storyline with empty characters. The heists and other jobs mostly consist of just killing people while avoiding being shot. A very small number of the heists are enjoyable, but you only hit them once and the game moves on to a lot of really boring content with really obnoxious and unappealing characters. The whole game is quite grotesque.The online content is what really killed it for me. Do you have three friends that are always on to play this game with you? No? Then don't count on online play. You are forced to run missions and heists with other people if you want to do them. There is no ai or solo option. If your teammates are dumb and keep getting themselves killed (90% of the time) then you have to restart the heist. If a member of your team leaves then it cancels the whole heist and you have to start over again from the beginning as well as remake the party.The online free modes are also mostly terrible. There are a few that are enjoyable, but all you can do is hope they pop up in the cycle when you want to join or vote on them for the next match once a match has ended IF the choices you like are availableOther than that there is just lot of people roaming around acting like jackasses and children rather aimlessly as hackers zip around and mess with people.Don't waste your money.",0.0

Shooting sucks so much that servers don't count any of 20 body shots on lying target on the ground and as soon as he gets up and shoots me in the head it counts it and no its not a cheat it's just servers. Loading time is longer, no matter SSD HDD, due to poor servers and on top of that cheaters in every single game lobby dropping event items under map or geting irrational score (like longest falling distance 9999999 when from top to bottom is about 15k). Also puting money and weapons in your character slot (yes pretty much like game admins) and geting you banned or robbed of all weapons/money due to YOU ""cheating"", beacuse rockstar.If you ever think about buying this game. Don't. It's the worst trash out there in video game industry.GTA V:Pretty fun, but shorter than any other game and lack of things to do. Like no cop, ambulance, taxi missions with bonuses to your stats. Minigames with pretty TERRIBLE rewards like 1,000$ and cheapest house costs 100,000$. The best income is robbing some money trucks for 6,000$, meanwhile you can buy a company for 1,000,000$, so if you don't invest on the stock market during assasination missions, you will have to grind for 400 hours just to buy a single company for a single mission.

By far the worst I have seen in any game. Second it is extremely buggy. Random disconnects, playing with friends often not working, and the gameplay itself is not bugfree either.When you do get to play it is not much better. The UI is terribly messy and hard to navigate, the goals are not very clear, user built races are just a terrible experience, you will get spawncamped A LOT.

"Take Two have milked this game dry. Microtransactions (Shark Cards that grant currency for GTA: Online) are their main motivation for keeping it up. The servers are peer-to-peer, which is terrible and cheaters are rife. Instead of making dedicated servers for the game, tthey decided to cheap out. The cheaters were able to modify your bank balance, explode you and everyone else in the lobby (and alter the killfeed to frame someone else for the kill) amongst other things. Instead of revamping how the servers operate in an attempt to make it harder for people to cheat, Take Two has decided to outright ban people from modding their game. It doesn't even matter if you only mod the game to affect Single Player (since going Online with mods enabled will get you banned from GTA: Online unless you're using some kind of cheat that bypasses this check, anyway), it's still not allowed. This is a heavy-handed, and downright stupid thing to do.In addition to that, with each update, items such as cars, clothing etc are priced outrageously, to the point where you'll probably need to fork out real money in order to afford them (unless you want to grind out repetitive missions/heists).The single player section of the game has been neglected for years. We've been waiting on DLC for it to hopefully expand the story (like GTA IV did with The Lost and Damned + The Ballad of Gay Tony), but this hasn't happened and probably won't for the foreseeable future.I did enjoy this game at launch and have put hundreds of hours into it, but I can't support what Take Two are doing. I'm very concerned about how they're going to handle Red Dead Redemption 2's multiplayer. I feel as if microtransactions will also be prominent there.",0.0

Seriously?**This could be a good game if Rockstar wasn't the most incompetent ♥♥♥♥♥ I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.You read a ton of these negative reviews thinking that these people are just unlucky, that it can't happen to you. I've been playing the game nonstop for a past week, making money for a bunker and new cars and in the middle of a game, I just got falsely banned for a month for no reason at all and my character and progress INSTANTLY reset.It's a shame because this is a blast to play with friends, but Rockstar just can't seem to manage♥♥♥♥♥♥with their own game. They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck. Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing? Modders and cheaters, the same that have been on the game ever since it first came to PC.This game will forever be garbage because of Rockstar.

"The story in Grand Theft Auto 5 is fairly good. For the recent price drop from $60 USD to $30 USD, I'd be more willing now to recommend this game to others than before. For the story only, of course. OnlineI cannot, in good concious, recommend this game for those buying it for online play. It's rife with script kitties, modders and hackers. Granted that some won't mess with you, but most will and usually try to get you banned and Rockstar won't care about what circumstances you found yourself in. Trust me, reporting these people won't do anything, even provided with video evidence of a script kittie/modder I was given a response a little like this; Step 1, assure we're committed to keeping the service free of modders, STep 2, issue generic step-by-step process to report people in game, Step 3, close ticket and forget about it.Given, some hilarity and fun can be had with people on the multiplayer side, but at this point I cannot recommend GTA5 for anyone looking at it for online. Half the decent money making methods are locked to public servers, which means high risk of modders and script kitties these days. So you'll either be dealing with people usually out to ban you or keeping to invite-only orclosed-friend servers. Again, the story is fairly decent. I'd rate it four out of five stars. For the new $30 USD price tag, I'd say wait for a sale before buying, grab it a bit cheaper for the story. Unless you have friends, stay out of online, or out of public servers. Never know when millions will start dropping on you then find yourself banned. Final DecisionAs soon as I see a change in how Rockstar is handling the online services and especially how they accept reports of hackers, modders and script kitties spawning money, cleaering peoples in-game money, so on and so forth, I'll change this review to be better favorable instead of recommending only half the game.Would recommend Story Mode, won't recommend Online Mode. Overall, wouldn't recommend.",1.0

You can blame Rockstar, Take Two o whoever you want, but people is like that. There's no online game without toxic people and this game is a good place for them. Some people will try to ruin your game just for fun.Biggest problem: modders. You will find a hacker in every two games. I find it unbelievable how usual it is to find a hacker. I really can't understand how Rockstar doesn't have anything prepared to detect them as soon as they're triggered, because they're everywhere, literally. It's a huge problem, you'll have to find a new server very often. Also you'll see a lot of kids asking for modders in the chat.If you can get around hackers and toxic people, you will find a great game.

"Log in the other day to the ONLINE mode. Upon seconds of logging in gave a player who drove by the middle finger who decided to reverse his car next me because he thought I needed a ride.

"Going to make this clear from the start: I have not modified my game files at all, singleplayer or multiplayer. However, today I was permanently banned from playing GTA Online for being caged by a hacker. The ban was unwarranted and was not deserved.The customer support staff were robots; ""all permanent bans are not appealable"". Despite my explaining to them about the grounds on which I was banned, they gave the same response, and ended the call.Support tickets for this type of thing are also immediately closed.Rockstar is a vile company, generating a lot of money from this game. They know that banned players will buy the game again, and players too afraid to touch mods will buy shark cards, or in-game currency.To Rockstar: Please, fix your broken auto-ban system. Me as well as hundreds of other innocent players are being caught in the net, and your blatant disregard for these players has shown me how unorganized and greedy your company is.To the player: Do not purchase this game.

"Wow, GTA V...It's here, the PC master race finally gets their hands on GTA V. This game, on ANY platform, is SPECTACULAR, probably one of Rockstars best works. Here are some pros and cons of this game. I'll only be looking at the singleplayer side of the game for now, might update Online in later.PROS ~Great NPC varietyAmazing graphics and open worldSo many activities3 Different playable charactersMemorable charactersCustomisation - So much of it!A long, long story, taking me around 20 hrs, without doing side missionsBut, with every good game, there are the consCONS ~Need a reasonably good rig to run this gameA few glitches here and there (Glitches will be updated later in the year)Rockstar Social has it's problems (Haven't encountered any personally)Price maybe could be a tad reduced considering this game has been out for 2 years nowKeyboard controls are not the best (I tried playing with mouse and keyboard, couldn't get used to it so switched to Xbox One controller)So, all in all, in my experience, I defiantly spent my money well, and this games selling point is probably Online, so if you have any friends who play this, defiantly pick it up.

Alot of games have negative reviews but are still good, so why would this one be any different?Will I be able to cover my guy in tattoos (biggest concern)?NOW, here is what happened when I bought the game....start online mode, run around for a bit, doing the online missions with Lamar.  Wasn't really what I wanted to do, but I appreciate prologues and missions that help you get used to the mechanics of the game.  Found a tattoo shop.  Was disapointed in the quality and diversity of the tattoos.  Only had 13,000$ in total so I couldn't even get that many.  Exited the game and was ready to start actually playing the next day and make some money.Next Day: Log on, ask the chat if anybody would be willing to help a noob.  Two guys said yes.  Awesome.  They brought me to a store and told me to rob it.  Go inside....BAM, instantly respawned with a bunch of other players to the middle of the street.  NO idea what's going on.  Guys I'm with say ""yep, heres a hacker"".  He lets us free.  Bam, spawns us in a bank and we can't escape.  MEANWHILE, my bank account is rising extremely fast and I now have all the guns.  Hacker kept us in there for a good 5-7 minutes.  Released us and brought us to the top of a mountain? He spawned in cars for us and I drove mine down the mountain.  Respawns us again to a boat yard of some sort.  Other players keep killing me and I keep respawning at this boatyard.  Final hack, he spawns me on a bird and I'm just sitting on it while flying over the ocean.  Can't commit suicide.  Can't move.  Can't do anything.  I ask nicely for him to put me down.  Takes a while, but he respawns me back at the boat yard.Now that I have a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of money, all the guns and realize that hackers do exist and it's quite annoying to deal with them, I can't play the game how I wanted it to be played.

My other bans however, were completely unwarranted and point to ""Proof in my user statistics"" which upon my own inspection show nothing of the sort. My third ban was due to residual mods from my singleplayer run I had installed. (This was after Rockstar stated that singleplayer mods would not affect online services btw).

"I understand wanting to combat hackers that are on GTA Online, and I am all for that, but messing with OpenIV and taking away the ability to mod the game for single player is just plain silly. I believe that most people who do mod the game are not in it to ruin other peoples fun, they mod to enjoy the singleplayer the way they want. I feel this is also on Rockstar too, as they once mentioned before bringing a storymode DLC but they have become money hungry and only release DLC for Online and want you to buy sharkcards. They stopped releasing the new cars for singleplayer in hopes they buy sharkcards online. Shame on both Take Two and Rockstar",1.0

I know I was so young to play a violent game which is I am not allowed but what can you say about if you are really a gamer and want to play a game that you ever wanted to? Haha well oh well up until now I am 23 years old I'd still love to play this game cause It's really amazing! the way game play, even though i'm not a pro at it but I could still kick 50dudes face In a row Include with my dying routine if they're really good to have fun with 1on1 or just some random hostile. Haha this why you gotta love and learn to play GTA world even though there's a bunch of hackers and modders I don't deal with them I will just leave the lobby or create a private session which is they're trying to broke down your gameplay which are those guys don't know how to play the rules.

"I am not one of those types to write reviews on steam but I think I should write one because I've been a fan since GTA 2:If you're buying this for SP - Don't pay this full price; wait until it goes on sale. This four year old game isn't worth the full price that you're expected to pay. It's good and it's what you expect for a typical GTA but again, the storymode is four years old at this point and getting certain things is bit of a grind that'll take forever to get (movie theatres and golf club). If you're buying this for MP - Unless you have a gang of friends to play with and have fun or a part of a invite only server, don't buy this game or the shark cards. This is the most asinine attempt of making an online MP Sandbox game. The payouts are so low compare of wanting to buy the stuff you want, you'll have to spend hours just to make a million (which a lot of items are, more or less, priced at). The grind and cooldowns are so bad, you might as well call this a MMO. It's impossible to join any of the fun modes because people only wanted to just mess around in the free word. There's always one or a few modders and script kiddies in every session because there's no real active moderation on these sessions. Before you can even try to report them, they just crash the game. People don't join up with the people wanting to get rid of these guys because they might get ""rewarded with free money"" Again, this game isn't worth full price when it's littered with modders and script kiddies running the place.These shark card prices are asinine as well, since everything is price around a million or two, you'll be shoveling hundreds, if not, thousands of dollars just get everything you want out of online mode. If you really need to play MP, play it on the PS4. (Sadly I don’t have one so I can’t enjoy online mode as a lot of people do)I got this game when it was 50% off, so I am happy when I got it but I would’ve never gotten this game for full price. I am still amazed this four year old game is still full price while games related to this and release around the same time has their price dropped to 40% from full price. I blame GTA Online artificially keeping the game at full price.   ",1.0

"GTAV is one of the best games I've ever played, both for single player and for multiplayer with friends. The story alone is enough to warrant anyone on the fence about this game. Its fun with but interesting characters, cool missions, great combat, and one of the best stories I've gotten to play though in my years of gaming. The multiplayer aspect of the game is really amazing as well as long as you have a few friends to play it with. At the time I'm doing this review having a corporation or a motorcycle club are both really cool ways to enjoy the game and sink a few hours into. For me personally the crown jewel of the multiplayer is the inclusion of heists. Heist are pretty similar to the ones found in the single player story and aside from one or two independent missions they are all excellent and definitely worth playing.",1.0

"WARNING: BEFORE BUYING, KNOW YOU CAN USE *NO* MODS AT ALL EVER, OR YOU ARE BANNED FROM THE ENTIRE ONLINE.  Luckily I found THAT out before I purchased it.GOOD WAY TO BURN LEGITIMATE CUSTOMERS!THIS COMPANY SENDS GOONS TO FOLKS HOUSES THAT WRITE MODDING APPSSingle player game is the good part... it's gta, if you like that sort of thing, then buy it.The SP experience is rather well-done and runs okay, turn off V-sync if you get the laggies (you'll know what I mean).  It's a shame this game defaults to vsync on, why I don't know.  Some people may like it, but it causes problems if your system isn't a 3000$ system.  Use HALF or OFF for Vysnc.Multiplayer... oh where to start.  Huge city with 32 ppl max... yeah ok.  Coming from Just Cause 2 multiplayer mod, this GTA has absolutely nothing to compare to it except AI in it.I am quite dissapointed by the cumbersome mess that is GTA Online, and won't be spending a penny more on this.Thank goodness the community is making a better front-end for the multiplayer - it's sorely needed.OOPS, ROCKSTAR SENDS GOONS AFTER YOU IF YOU MAKE MODDING TOOLS.That's the most messed up thing I've ever heard.No more rubbish from this company on my computer.  Now that they've issued a take-down notice to OPENIV modding application, I can safely delete this waste of space from my hard drive.  However, if you want to hand-feed the greedy devs who hate their customers having free fun with their product IN SINGLEPLAYER, then fine, instead of buying a house or car IN REAL LIFE, WASTE MONEY ON SHARK CARDS.  No, use the money for another Steam game that you can mod.Besides, Beamng.drive's physics are 100x better, seriously, this game has nothing on it other than some story (which was good), guns, and random AI traffic you don't have to self program.If you just like crashing about and making a wreck of things play Beamng.drive, as the physics in GTAV are laughable at best in comparison.",1.0

SOMETIMESShort:DONT GET THE GAME!!!Save your money, get this game off some website where you can get a key for cheap if you really want to. online=grind. Long:     Dont get this game in 2018... if you are even reading this... just don't do it... this game is only fun for a very small amount of time, after so, you would want to take long breaks from the endless grind this game requires (authors note: I am not a very good with money so take it with a grain of salt... nor am I patient enough for most grinding) However, the game does give you a great time if you aren't into the freemode stuff. I do recommend the races, especially the user made stunt ones. Races are great with freinds... not that I have any that play them with me...      BUT ANYWAYS... it's still not worth the purchase unless you get this game from somewhere cheap. 60 dollars or even the 50% off 30 dollars isn't worth your hard earned cash. However... this game does serve a niche in the market as there aren't many other open world games I could recomend over this... unless you include GTAIV (which I have never played), and The original red dead redemption (which I also have never played).      From a person who has played many F2P games, I know when I smell Pay 2 Win or Pay 2 Progress, and this game stinks of the latter. However, I understand the business side of this game, and although I do not support the extent it has gone to try to dry our pockets, they have at least added some new content to the game. Simply put, it is most likely that liscensing for the music in the game does not come cheap for Rockstar. (from experience researching music liscensing for youtube)Conclusion:      if I only look at this game in 2018, I would barely suggest getting the game when it is on sale. I am honestly still enjoying this game from time to time, but that does not mean that I would support this game.

"The game isn't free to play, its pay to play (obviously), and is then constantly pay to win, and unless you have 24 hours, 5 days a week to replay the same missions OVER and OVER again to grind about $5,000, you'll get bored of the game before you can afford anything worthwhile. Most games that do this are usually free to play, and use this to make a profit off of their game, and you can't say that the DLC are free if all the items are locked behind the ingame currency, with the useful item being worth over $50usd.Every item you buy eventually becomes obsolete too, and becomes about as useless as the cars civies drive around town, meaning buying any item online is pointless.For example, a new tank gets released that needs to get hit 10+ times with an old tank, and can destroy the old tank with one hit. Later that ""new"" tank will become obsolete with a newer tank that destroys the ""new"" tank in one hit. Now replace the word ""tank"" with any other word, and you've got GTA Online.And public lobbies are jam packed full of hackers and modders, who will spawn vision blockers on your character, spawn UFOs, boulders, wind turbines, and not do any good deed like drop ingame cash, or actually have fun.

RockStar has made 3 billion dollars off of selling this game NOT INCLUDING ALL THE EXTRA STUFF YOU PAY FOR AFTER PURCHASING IT.For those who will actually read:The following is a request/support ticket I've submitted to the Rockstar social club (but the text-limit for a request description is too short so I had to type it in Microsoft paint and submit the rest of it in an image which I didn't include here):(NOTE: The included screenshots of the conversation with the person trolling me are out of context due to not taking enough screenshots frequently enough.)http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341155039http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341155182http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341155258Screenshot 4:http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1341155350The 'social club' account is currently suspended from being able to access the online portion of ""grand theft auto"".I have eventually come to the realization that I have payed actual real life money/currency to interact with pixels and sound-effects/etc. on a computer-monitor/speakers, only to be 'suspended' from being allowed to continue to play the game.However, even if you [basically the company] (miraculously somehow...) agreed to refund the money I've spent to purchase the ability to play the game, I no longer have the pre-paid visa gift card I used to buy it, over a year before the day I'm typing this... (the game was purchased by myself on the date of Feb 18th, 2017)Even when my account is eventually unsuspended a month from now, I will barely be motivated to play GTA Online anymore, due to being suspended under absolutely unreasonable circumstances, and then, basically, becoming totally outraged over the entirely obscene situation, obviously getting angry that it ever happened.I could give several points and reasons why I shouldn't be suspended, but, instead, am breaking the 4th wall on the the fact that I payed real life money to be able to play this game, and now I can't play this game...To whatever employee is reading this, there is honestly nothing you can do, and nothing I can do, and I think we both realize that this world is not a perfect place and is actually very screwed up.I am just bothering to send this ticket because a friend of mine urged me to repeatedly, and even though I told him it'd make no difference, I'm sending it in anyway. I have no idea if this will make any difference involving how the company treats or provides services to those who pay for those services, and my common sense tells me this will just be another insignificant message which makes no actual difference.Basically the purpose of this message is I've genuinely gotten very emotionally upset, angry, frustrated from this experience. I am not even getting what I really payed for, unless I ironically considered that I was 'paying' for the terms of service and stuff which sort of came with the game, so I, legally, in a twisted way, payed to agree to have myself suspended, etc.UPDATE: I received a reply:""Hello Insane_David40,Your account is temporarily suspended from GTA Online.

And Rockstar fights this by earasing weeks of your time and effort put into this game (that you have to grind out in order to afford anything fun without micro transactions) by using an automated sytem that resets your account to what it thinks it was originally.

If you do plan on getting this for Story mode/Modding, I'd HEAVILY recommend you get it on sale.Why is GTA:O bad you may ask? Well heres a a list:-Hackers are almost in every single public lobby I have even been in. (Encounters vary from Person to person)-E X T R E M E grindfest, makes Warframe (a F2P that has a fair bit of grind to it) look childish in terms of grinding. *Basically P2W since Doomsday Heists.-This could be a neutral or bad, but most Online content requires other players, going solo is pretty much super hard, and even MORE grindy than if you were with, say another person.-Everything (except maybe the Vanilla content) is also insanely expensive. Hense the stupid insane grindfest.-First few hours are actually fun, afterwards, it feels like you only work to get things, and hardly ever have fun.-The new update, Gunrunning, has completely ♥♥♥♥ed balance. Anyone who is brand spanking new will get eviscerated.  ^ -And to add to this, vehicles from Import/Export are now almost completely useless. The only one that can do anything to anyone would be the ruiner 2K, but even then, you'd probably get one-shotted by a Heavy Sniper w/ Explosive rounds.  *^^ -And to add EVEN MORE to this, Doomsday Heist Update has completely ♥♥♥♥ed balance even more than gunrunning. The power creep is absolutley insane, and so is the prices.-Shark cards are no longer worth the money due to the absolutely insane inflation of prices. Getting a yacht with nothing but shark cards will cost you around 100 USD.***Hey Take Two and Rockstar,You wanna know WHY people hack,mod, and glitch on GTA:O?Because your buisness practices/models are completely and absoutley horrible.If you didn't further the grind and didn't shove Micro-transactions down our throats  You guys wouldn't put so much effort and time banning and patching. Seriously, you really thing this buisness model is going to fly in RDR 2's Online? You must be out of your goddamned mind if you really think that it will turn out well and NOT recieve backlash.Wanna get on the good side of your playerbase?

ADJUST YOUR SHARKCARDS FROM THE INFLATION I GUARENTEE YOU WILL GET MORE SALES IF YOU DO.***That's pretty much all I can think of at the top of my head, but i'll probably update this later.TL;DRDon't buy for Online, buy for modding/story, wait until its on sale.",1.0

"Sorry but GTAV is no good. Take Two made sure of that beyond the game's already♥♥♥♥♥♥flaws. Everything about this game is rinse and repeat copy and paste. Only a handful of missions are fun and the rest are all the same. The online is nothing but a grind that feels very much like an app. As you level up you gain more ammo capacity and more weapons, costing more and more. This means you have to keep working to get that nice car you want but in the process the ceiling keeps getting higher and higher taking longer and longer to get it. This goes on until you've got to a high level where unlocks are slower. There's no go-to mission or thing to make money. Every content release is just another failed attempt to get people to buy shark cards to ""make more money"" which if you do your research, people who calculate this crap show you lose money and take forever to make back what you spent. The rest of the online is a total wreck. They ban everyone they possibly can for no reason yet there's still people teleporting around spawning crap and killing who they please with hacks. They just stop people who try to work around their shark card system not the actual hackers. I'm honestly surprised the multiplayer isn't completely dead these days. It looks like more people are on FiveM but that's just me.",1.0
"Wow, I just noticed I am nearing 800 hours in GTAV. I think that calls for a summerized review. Okay, I am sure I am going to take heat here for going against the current trend of negative reviews for this game. That is okay I love speaking my mind, I can handle any criticizm that anyone has. To be frank, no one of us is right or wrong in our reviews. A review or critique is just a matter of opinion anyways, and I am just sharing mine. I respect everyone else's since freedom of speech and personal expression should be a right for every human.Okay having nearly 800 hours played here, I have to definitely recommend GTAV for anyone who is a fan of the series and somehow has not bought it yet or if you are a fan of sandbox/multiplayer games in general. I don't work for Rockstar and am not a fan boy, I happen to have over 30 years of experience as a gamer. I have had the blessing of watching the birth of the gaming industry and watch it become what it is today. I know there is a lot of anger right now toward Take Two and Rockstar over their new stance on modding. My review is based only on the vanilla game. I have never used a mod in the game and I have nothing at all against modding in a single-player offline setting. Now the single player mode while good, to me the story in no way compares to the depth of GTAIV. I like all of the characters  especially Tevor, but not receiving any additional DLC for the story mode like in the previous games leaves me wanting more.Now where GTAV falters a bit in the story mode, the online mode more than makes up for it. I am fortunate to have a vast number of good and trustworthy friends to play with in online mode and let me tell you there is no online game on any platform that gives you the play variety of GTAV online. You can race in a huge variety of vehicles, environments, and modes. Do you like shooting? There is such a huge variety of modes where you can team up with your friends or go in an all out deathmatch it will make your head spin. Oh man, I am just getting started! You even have tennis and golf. While simplistic and not perfect, these modes are also a blast to play with friends. The quailty while not perfect, definitely is better than a mediocre stand alone golf/tennis game. Want more? Go play some darts, run some CEO missions, Call some friends to do a challenging prision break heist! There are hours and hours upon missions and events in free mode there is not enough room here to list them all. Suffice to say, there should be something for everyone here. I know I know, a lot of the nice things are expensive in GTAV. I like that. In real life, you have to work hard to earn things like that nice home, or a nice new car. Things earned though effort bring about appreciation and satisfaction. I know this is just a game, but too often now days people look for the easy way out...say money drops on everyone in the session. The modding online was getting to be so ridiclous you could spawn in a public session and get modded instantly. Modding people that don't want it is wrong and unfair not to mention cheating in a PvP environment gives you a fake sense of satisfaction if you ''win.'' They may have went a bit far when they banned mods in the offline mode but something had to be done to restore the original playing experience the game was intended to provide online. That is final thought on GTAV. Knowing every weekend I get to do 100's of different events with my friends makes me feel satisfied I bought this game. It is a must buy, but wait for a sale. The price of $59.99 USD is way to high for a 2+ year old game.",1.0

"This is my first, and likely to be my only ever Steam review of a game, but given current events I felt it necessary to say something.First things first, GTA V is a good game, all in all. It provides for hours of hijinks and entertainment, but can easily become monotonous. GTA Online had the potential to be a repreive from this monotony, but was handeled with such greed and a complete and blatant disregard for its audiance that it's frankly insulting.The ""gameplay"" offered by GTA Online is based entirely around a grind for cash and RP for leveling, and many gameplay elements are blocked out to the player unless they have enough cash or a high enough level. This not only serves to prolong this feeling of monotony, but also stips the gameplay of any of the fun that could be acheived in the singleplayer.This is only worsened by the games use of microtransactions, ""graciously"" allowing players to skip the ridicilous and unnecessary grind by rewarding the player with cash and RP in exchange for ridicilous amounts of real money. For instance, the price of a yacht in in-game currency is $8,00,000 which translates to either dozens of hours spent in-game grinding, or $100 in real world currency.GTA Online is also completely hostile to new players; new players, lacking the necessary level or cash to have access to any decent vehicles, weaponry, armor, housing, and vehicle storage have no way to combat the more experienced players or those who chose to pay for their levels and cash. This makes it nearly impossible for new players to advance in the game without having to waste their money on microtransactions, as they will not be able to compete with the other players.This monotony could, and was, eliminated through the use of mods, giving the player a potentially indefinite amount of hours of hijinks and entertainment through the hard work of dedicated modders. Unfortunately, and what I find has proven to be the nail in this games coffin, the game's publisher Take-Two issued a cease-and-desist to OpenIV, one of the major modding tools of GTA V, used by most of the better mods. Now, I am no lawyer so I could be completely off base, but from my limited understanding this cease-and-desist has no actual basis, but instead is just an assualt on the modding community and on the fans. Unfortunately, independent modders don't have the funds necessary to challenge a multi-million publishing company in court, so instead they've been allowed to get away with this frankly disgusting behavior.Without mods, I cannot honnestly recommend this game, nor would I want to, and I'd recommend that potential buyers avoid this game for the time being, if for nothing more than to send a message to the publishers that we will not tolerate such greed and disgusting, underhanded business practices.On another note, the keyboard controls or terrible, but the game has controller support, so it's not that much of an inconvenience.TL;DRAvoid this game unless the publishers go back on their current practices and begin to, at the very least, tollerate the existance of mods.",1.0
"GTA 5 was a great game overall, but recently, rockstar has been making these a lot worse for those playing online, such as banning many innocent players (apparently, they don't tell you why specifically, they just ban you), as well as jacking up the price of the new dlc vehicles, making it almost impossible to get good vehicles in the game without having to resort to either buying shark cards, which they want you to do, which mean paying lots of money, or using a mod. At this current state, you should buy a different game  if you want to play with friends. However, the single-player aspect of the game is very good.",1.0

"It was a great game at one point, I remember playing it on the PS3 when it came out.Over the years though it kinda soured. The campaign is still fun to play, but GTA online isn't all the fun it use to be.I can't recommend this game for multiplayer, but for the campaign i would recommend it.",1.0
Was a really good game and it still is. Tons of fun await in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Really recommended 10/10.,1.0
"So this is without a doubt one of the most polished PC ports I have seen in quite some time. Although I have found that as of late every update that comes with this game also drastically impacts performance. Now I know that most of you are thinking that this is entirely on me, and that my rig isn't up to the task of running this game but I know my specs and I'll be damned if this thing can't run this game or any other game for that matter.Anyways the game itself is one of the most enjoyable online experiences I've had in a long time, and for all of you out there that prefer to go it alone this game delivers an amazing story with rich gameplay and diverse campaign missions. There was never once that I felt that I was doing something as ""filler"" only existing to lengthen the time needed to finish the game. The gun play is extremely polished and feels fluid, although first person view while shooting feels awkward as hell, but while driving it is my go to view.This is my first Grand Theft Auto game, so I can't speak as to how it compares or differs from past titles but despite that on its own this game is definitely worth the price. Although if you want the best experience, in my opinion of course, then I recommend you have a friend who also has the game and play with them online. I haven't enjoyed a multiplayer experience like this is ages, there truly is nothing quite like being in a car chase while being shot at by police with armored vans, helicopters and swat vehicles. All in all the game feels polished, plays like a top of the line AAA game, has a great campaign full of interesting characters, missions and gameplay. This is a game you should probably keep an eye out for during steam sales!",1.0

"If you don't own GTAV for PC, get it. It is honestly an amazing game alone or with friends and considering I wasn't 100% on-board on getting it, my mind has definitely been changed for the better.Single PlayerThe single player campaign is extremely good and fleshed out, amazing if you have a weekend or so without internet and need a catching and enjoyable story to play. While lacking after completion, modding is definitely something to consider if you are careful with your installations and an amazing community means there is always something to try out.PRO's- Great story with 3 great characters leads me to believe a new GTA won't be able to ever beat it. - Characters are interesting to say the least but all lead to an overall amazing.- Open world is diverse with countless opportunities for chaos and shenanigans.- Modding community is great (although players have to be careful with installation and usage with online)- Choice with some important decisions give you some control over the direction as to how missions and jobs play out, but generally stays the same no matter what.CON's- Little replay-ability- Single Player modding could get you banned online if not careful- After finishing campaign there is little to do unless you enjoy searching for plants and scraps of paper.- No new contentOnlineOnline is where most of my hours have been chugged. At first glance it is grindy, unfair and chaotic. At second glance it's exactly the same. But through all of it, a good crew and a bit of time can make you rich and keep you entertained for a long time ahead. While many complain that online is repetitive and grindy like an MMO, GTA:O can definitely be a fun time with friends or a trustable crew. As long as you are smart with what you do and how you deal with people in-game, you won't regret playing.PRO's- Vast and ""interesting"" community- Constantly updated- Customisability and individuality- Insanely fun when the top dogCON's- Forces you to grind for money unless you want to pay for microtransactions.- Only really good money making methods are exploits or grinding ~10 hours.- A lot of players are KOS- Modders/Hackers are uncommon but painful (only have found ~6 in 260 hours).- Newer players are helpless unless they play smart.- Can be banned for single-player modding.- Money = Power9/10 - Single player is amazing, Online is hell until you acquire cash. In the world of GTA, Money = Power. And this is the evidence of it. Get this game on sale or for full price. Either or, you won't regret it. Only thing that lowers the score for me at least is the single-player modding issues that you could face if done incorrectly, but overall this game is great.",1.0

"To be honest I probably wouldnt've bought this game if it wasn't for the online. The base game didn't really interest me that much. But in my opinion the singleplayer side of the game is fine. This is mainly my take on the multiplayer side... and why it sucks. First of all, it's become sort of a meme at this point how long the loading screens are. It's almost unacceptable that it can take upwards of five minutes to load into gta online, and if you don't happen to load into the same session as your friend, that's another minute or so that you have to wait. Just so that this review doesn't go on forever, I'll quickly list the many other problems with GTA Online. Toxic community that will kill you on sight for no reason. Days of mindless grinding are almost manditory if you want to make money legitley (which I didn't, ♥♥♥♥ that). Every purchaseable item is designed to coax you into buying in-game currancy (for instance the maximum amount of money you can buy is 8,000,000-gta$ for 100 real dollars which can only buy about three high end cars or one or two of the businesses. that is NOT WORTH $100 on top of the $60 price tag). To conclude, ever since I paid a modder and got 1b-gta$ for like $5 I haven't felt a need to play this game unless there's a new update, so I've basically been playing once every few months. There are a few fun moments to be had, but that's only if you're absolutely loaded. Can't recommend gta online (however if you liked previous gtas, then I recommend the singleplayer story).",1.0
Best GTA so far,1.0
"I came from a position where I NEVER played a Grand Theft Auto game before. I had niether high nor low hopes, and entered the game completely neutral. And I thoroughly enjoyed it. GAMEPLAY: You can really tell that the developers spent a great deal of time designing and perfecting how the game feels, and it a quinticential 3rd person game. It handles movement and viewing tremendously. Never does it feel awkward or annoying. 100/100GRAPHICS:Stunning, to say the least. Even with a PC that boasts a budget GPU like mine, it ran well over 80 FPS even on the highest settings. The graphics makes Los Santos pop, and it really feels like a living, breathing creature of a game. Graphical glitches were not noticable, if there even was any. 100/100. Incredibly well optimized.SOUNDTRACK: Each musical queue felt fitting and energizing, and the inclusion of a radio in cars makes the world feel that much more real. 100/100.STORY (spoiler free):This is where the game comes across a lot of criticism and controversy. YES. I KNOW. THERE ARE CHARACTERS THAT DO BAD THINGS AND SAY BAD THINGS AND SUPPORT THE SAYING AND DOING OF BAD THINGS. WELCOME TO REALITY. PEOPLE CAN BE MEAN. WOOPTY-F*CKING-DOO. But the game really has a funny and fun story, with characters that, while they aren't morally sound, are fun and interesting nonetheless. Trevor Phillips' character is a great example. He's a completely sadistic b*stard, and his voice acting, modeling, and missions fit his character to a tee, and he has since become one of my favorite characters in gaming. The story is fun, interesting, with twists and turns and is of decent length. It has some annoying, repeatative, and bad missions, no doubt, but thats the only failing feature of the story. 90/100.PRICE: I hate the price of this game. It is amazing, but it is NOT worth $60. I got it on sale when it was $35, and I would encourage anyone who wants the game to wait until it is on sale before purchasing it. 70/100.OVERALL: 83.75/100. When on sale, that bumps up to 95/100.

"Hello, I am very BIG fan of GTAV. I have over 750+ hours of this game. I know this game in and out. Rockstar has done some shaddy things in their life of this game. The modding incedient is its hit new low. I (being a fellow modder on both singleplayer and online) and very dissapointed in Rockstar and Take 2. Being a modder online is frowned upon. But personally I had a great run. Most people think that Rockstar hasn't done anything to fix their online modding situation and has instead focused more on the singleplayer modding community. I am here to say that is not only true, but it's wrong. My mods for online were expensive and quite functional. But, they actually took the steps to figure out the injection method of this modification. They did infact successfully figure it out, and I was banned, PERMANATLY. But they havn't spoken about that much because they dont want modders to know about their plans. Though they have worked on the singleplayer issue more that the online one, it's still being done.

I've hundreds of hours on both platforms but as the years went by the game went from an actual fun game to just adding sharkcards and multimillion dollar supercar DLC's, now it has gone down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with all that it ever was. I'm not gonna say anything about the whole Take Two modding thing becuase I don't think that is relevant if you're are not modding it. The game is just now based on luxury, 4 million dollar supercars, owning a big organizations, and buying shark cards. It has left behind the GTA feeling that it started out with. GTA now is about living the rich life with bikes that can fly and expensive yachts. The feeling from GTA SA, Vice City, GTA 4 etc is now gone. This just don't feel like GTA anymore with all these new dlc's containing the exact same stuff over and over again. They need to move on from this game and go forward, now they are just milking money from it. Adding expenisive stuff or flying bikes is not gonna rescue or make this game better by any chance.

"DON'T get this game if you want to play online. I sunk about 150 hours of my time into working hard on GTA. Huge amounts of people who are wealthy on it had literally just done money drops. I, however, worked hard for my money. I did jobs, heists etc. I saved up for a motorcycle club, an apartment, a hanger, and had just got a nightclub. I had kept my finances as good as possible and I enjoyed playing the game with my friends.Then, out of nowhere, I was banned. Literally, for no reason. Now, I know that a lot of hackers and money drop enthusiasts might whinge about getting banned and make up exuses. But I was LITERALLY banned for absolutely no reason. I had worked hard, played the game fair, and done what I could to earn money. I was trolled by hackers, abused by the wealthy, and♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥on for driving poor cars. But did any of those people get banned? No. It was the person that played the game legit that got banned. When I got the notification, I was in absolute disbelief, I thought it was a joke. Then I tried to go online and it had said that my account had been banned for 30 days and deleted. I checked my emails and this was confirmed with the statement ""decisions are final and may not be appealed"". As we speak I am deleting the game. I enjoyed my time on it, but I am not playing another 150 hours just to level up and get banned again. I had no idea that Rockstar games was this corrupt and would ban an individual that loved their game. I don't reccommened anyone to get this game. It's incredibly unfair that I was banned for breaking the eula agreement when I have no idea what rule I broke. Don't purchase this if you want to play online legitimately.",1.0

The game is good until a point in the GTA V main story everytime i try to continue the story it freezes the game every time i hit the same spot in the story mission... it makes it so difficult to enjoy a game that tells you to uninstall to fix this issues where on the the PC we have the ablility to scan the files and mend them without the drama. but yet uninstall. GTA online also has its problems i dont crash the game there there is just to many hackers that take away our weapons and our money. the game needs to go under a major Retrofit before more players decide to leave it completly...Sentinel Nova of RJGC,1.0

"Grand Theft Auto 5 - 3rd/1st person game with huge open sandbox world, where you drive, shoot and cause havoc among other things.To start it off, I will say that this time around map size has increased by A LOT, compared to previous games. Game world feels more alive (at least in Story mode), with pedestrians, people in traffic, airplanes, helicopters, etc., going through their daily routes and assigned tasks. Every location you visit is populated by set number of active NPC's that talk to each other, interact with environment or even with you when you pass them by. Be it simple sidewalk with random pedestrians, lifeguard station near the beach or sawmill by the forest, far away from the city. Basically game has everything from it's predecessors and much more added on top. Like always there are many different kind of ground, water and air vehicles in the game that you can either steal or buy from ""internet"" in game. Clothing stores where you can buy outfits for your characters either in Story or Online. Same goes for barber, that can change your hairstyle and some face features.Story follows three main characters who will interact with one another more as game goes on, with their own set of problems, their own unique personalities, background and skills. You can freely switch between them, play through their specific story or side missions, take part in activities, change their clothing, visit barber, browse in game ""internet"" and more. Each of them have their own safe house, vehicle, amount of money, number of friends and/or enemies, one even has a dog who likes to leave big piles of dung everywhere.In GTA5 you are back in Los Santos, an ""island"" if you will. But this time around you have more than a city to play in. Game has different regions you can visit, from busy city streets and suburbs, airport, ship port, army base to desert country land with farms, mountain areas with forests, lakes, rivers and much more. You can also explore the underwater around the island and lakes in submarine or ""on foot"", meet some hikers while on bike ride in mountains, walk down the beach and take a ride on a jetski or take awkward yoga classes with your wife, watch movie in theatre, play tennis, darts or golf game, etc. Those are only few of the things you can do in game.Once in a while you will stumble on events like: person being mugged for money; someone stealing a vehicle; police chasing some criminals; couple drunk guys needing a lift; crashed car on the freeway with people in need of help; etc. And you can choose to help them, drive past or watch to see what will happen. Small things like that really bring life to the game.Environments are filled with a lot of interactable objects, miscellaneous props, and going through a back alley in a car, chased by police feels mighty satisfying when you go through pile of trash cans, fences and such. World is filled not only with people but also some variety of wildlife and domestic animals, be it simple dogs, cats or rats on the street to deer's, mountain lions, birds, cows, chickens, pigs, whales, dolphins, sharks, etc. You can even hunt wildlife and get paid for it. Sadly animals are somewhat limited to Story mode, and not that easy to come by in Online.Game looks good up close, with good texture quality and rich environment detail. But lacks detail past few dozen meters, objects look blurred, distant detail is very poor even on highest settings. Character model quality is good only on main story characters, and isn't that good on random pedestrians and 2nd grade characters. Facial animation is strong in cut-scenes and somewhat weak outside of them. Detail on vehicles and vehicle damage is great, though sometimes you wonder how it can still drive after you ""shaved the train"" couple dozen times, and you barely can tell what car looked like brand new.Apart from Story mode, you can play Online mode in either private / friend or public lobby. You start off by creating your character, join crew, do missions, versus PVP games, races in land, air or water vehicles, activities like darts, golf, tennis and much more, similar to Story mode, but hand crafted for Online and up to 30 people. Everything you do will grant you experience, cash and increase your skills, depending on what you do. Higher your level, the more stuff you unlock, the more jobs and missions become available to you. You earn money, you buy and modify cars you purchase living quarters or garage, when you get bored from driving you can buy airplanes or choppers to rain havoc from air or simply take a break from madness on the ground high above the skies, but remember you're never safe from a guided missile even if it's from a friend. Main attraction in Online mode is Heists, where you do series of setup jobs in 4 player team that leads to a finale mission, that will reward everyone with decent amount of cash. Currently there are five available Heists, with each following different kind of crime, with different set of characters and increasing amount of paycheck.Personally I had a lot of fun in Online mode, some enjoyable moments in Story mode and around 200 hours of playtime so far. And I'm still not completely done with it, though I'm struggling because you will get bored eventually. Apart from some personal issues with how game looks in distance, and other minor complaints, this game is very well optimized, runs great on PC with recommended system requirements, looks good and is fun to play. Enjoy.",1.0

"Take Two are ruining one of the best modding communities in history. This isn't what Rockstar originally stood for and I cannot reccommend this game to anyone until Take Two stop being greedy and treating fans like a wallet there for the taking. To anyone reading, support modding devs, support FiveM, support anyone trying to make GTA V a better game. If you do still buy it, I understand, but please do not fund Online through in game purchases, and please check out the modding scene. Everyone please speak out against this. Together we can change the state of this game or at least GTA VI if we make an impact. Negative reviews will make a huge dent. They ruin a games reputation, stop people from buying the game and get the media to speak up about it. It may be an extreme way to acheive change, but trust me, Take Two and Rockstar can both afford it. They are rich companies, treat them as such. We support them for good games and protest bad behaviour.Thank you to every modder and person spreading the word of modding or even just installing mods. You are the ones making a difference, not companies like Take Two.",1.0

"As far as GTA's go, the best one to release so far in terms of graphics, physics, and characters-you-don't-completely-hate-and-aren't-absolute-scumbags.  Enjoy the campaign, but do play online at your own risk.  This is the single most toxic online community I have ever seen in my near-thirty years of existence.   Between outright being harrased by openly-modding players, (being frozen, teleported, blown up on the spot, having weapons removed, put in a cage, forced to dance, having your character literally being e-r*ped from behind while frozen, [the animations are taken from a paparazzi mission under franklin], to fighting people with infinite health and ammo with all weapons and weapons they shouldn't have like the railgun, etc.), to just standard trolly players who will jetstrafe you with explosive rounds incessantly, and if grounded, will probably marksman-rifle you in 1-2 shots to death near-instantly because they've been practicing it for far longer than anyone who can work a full-time job has the chance to.These same mental midgets will then call you a p*ssy for using passive mode just to get some damn breathing room and who value K/D as if GTAV is the single most competitive and skill-based shooter in existence. What's worse, the community is now so intimately comfortable and familiar with modding that they'll regularly shout into the lobby for free money, and when modders do attack and start screwing with everyone, no one can take the time to get into the vote kick function and remove them, no matter how much you plead with them to do so.  It can work, and you can have fun, but the best bet to doing this is playing with a majority of friends in the lobby, so that you have kick-vote authority. Good luck with that in a full lobby though. Players won't hear you out and no one will get kicked, even a player who is obviously modding to screw with people for over an hour straight.I don't know what, if any, measures are being taken to combat both modders and griefers, but it isn't enough and probably won't be.  The sad thing is, they're adding in a lot of cool extra content to multiplayer. It's just a pain to bother playing in when it seems you have a 60 or > % chance of running into trolls or modders in any given lobby. So.. at it's core, a very decent game, and working and making money and doing missions and all that is so very fun with a good crew.  But this community is the most toxic I have ever seen, and they are, easily, breaking this experience that millions have paid to have access to.There also seems to be this very disturbing mindset going around that 'it is GTA, therefore you should be trolling players'.  I don't know where people get this idea, as nothing in the campaign or in any of the GTA games encourages you to kill everything that moves all the time. If anything, this is at it's most basic form, a game about making money and profits from crime.",1.0

"I haven't played GTA V for the past year, but I decided to play it again earlier today. I had a few mods that were out of date, so I decided to update them with OpenIV. To my suprise Rockstar / TakeTwo have ordered a cease and desist against OpenIV, which in turn has effectivley killed modding in GTA V. Modding is what the PC platform is known for and my main reason for purchasing GTA V on PC. Do yourself a favour and DO NOT BUY this game. Rockstar / TakeTwo are attempting to cash in by forcing people to use GTA Online by having exclusive content to MP not available in SP. MP is now riddled with microtransactions and hackers which really spoils the fun of the game.If you care about PC gaming then please, once again, DO NOT BUY GTA V!",1.0

"Grand  Theft Auto 5 has a great story line with a very interesting cast, some missions are very fun or exciting but there are the odd view that  tend to be alot slower in pace and seem to be there for padding. but overall the campaign is fun and exciting and there is lots todo and there is a large range of side missions and activitys to complete. the port on the other hand is something to be desired. its not the worse but i have a i5 4670k and a 980ti. i understand that is not the best CPU but it should work just fine. however i am met with frame drops when driving no matter what settings and no matter how high i put the AA i seemed to still be greeted with a jaggy mess. i believe the performance has seemed to get worse as patches are released so im not sure whats happening there to be honest. then the worst part of this package by far is the online. this is littered with hackers and after the handful of heists are finished in one sitting there is little left to do other than try and make your own fun and have that shot down by the previously mentioned hackers. believe it or not i have owned this game 5 times. PS3,PS4,360,XONE and now on PC. im sorry to say that this is the least fun ive had with this game, im not sure if the charm has finally worn off, but it simply felt more at home on the console and seemed to work better as a package.",1.0
"First of all, story mode is great.But since the multiplayer is the only thing Rockstar is updating, i'll leave my review to it.Started nice, cool multiplayer and fair, no hackers or anything.Then came the Heists, the best update the game had, incredibly fun to play.But then started the be rich, a hacker, play the game ALL DAY LONG EVERY DAY, get money from other hackers OR give up.Because, this WILL happen to you:Spawn killed by level 1000+ with armored weaponized vehiclesChange to passive mode and because of that, not being able to play the game the way it was meant to be.So then there's the new updates, innovative ways to earn money.Steal cars/Steal supplies or something like that.""Okay, i'll create a private session to play with my friend or alone, so I can do these missions in piece""Y O U  C A N ' TAnd there you have two options:1 - Try and to the missions on a public session and fail everytime, because let's be honest, how in the hell are you supposed to escape from jets/tanks/armored vehicles/whatever the ♥♥♥♥ they add next with normal cars/slow trucks?2 - Force your internet to run slow so you can join an empty public session (until someone logs in and ♥♥♥♥ up your fun with the things above).And also, there's this mod thing you all know about.I think it was time to post this review.

"Well, what can i say, GTA is GTA.I remember when i had PS1 and a disk of GTA 1 - one radio station, one point of view, but it was gooood. After all this years, GTA is still gooooood.I have only one question - why can't I play a story mode in Offline mode ? I've tried a lot, but it always telling me ""cannot connect to server"", but since i want to play in Story mode, i guess, i don't need no servers to play. It worked before updates, now it's not.P.S.

"If you are thinking about buying this game for GTA Online, then don't. There are just way to many hackers to warrant it and Rockstar doesn't seem to be doing anything to fix it. However. the campaign is absolutely superb. Now I've never played a GTA game before, and I committed the ultimate sin by pre-ordering this game, but it was so worth it. The plot is a mixture of absurdly good fun and a few serious moments, with lots of laughs along the way. The three main characters are well written and likable, even if they are criminals, and each of them is fun to play. The open world that the developers have built is absolutely stunning, from the peak of Mount Chiliad to the depths of the ocean, all of which is explored through the campaign. The main missions and side missions are both insanely fun, especially the heists (both the planning for and the execution). The combat is fluid and fun as is the driving, however, flying a helicopter with a mouse and keyboard is perhaps the single most frustrating thing I've ever experienced (although maybe that's just me and my knobbly fingers). The vehicle upgrades and customization are really extensive. The radio stations are, in my opinion, one of the best parts, with a phenomenal amount to choose from - it really makes Fallout 4 pail in comparisonAs I said previously, GTA online is almost unplayable with the amount of hackers. But the UI is also a problem, it's really hard to navigate playlists and hard to find friends. Joining races or playlists can also be really buggy, I tried to do a heist but I couldn't join, but now Lester rings me every five minutes to give me details on the heist.All in all, the single player is superb, the multiplayer sucks, but this is a really good game. And even if it was delayed a lot, I'm glad the PC version turned out so well.",1.0

"I am going to give my honest opinion. I never really cared for really any kind of modding in this game (singleplayer or rp servers). I know that take two has messed up if that wasn't obvious from all the other 99% of reviews. I know it's not because of taking Opev VI was asked to stop, it's the reason, from what I know there wasn't any reason to make Open VI stop. However you should not be getting mad about something that is not even really meant to be in the game in the first place. This does make me want to try an RP server or mod in singleplayer a bit more. I just wish all these reviews were about the base game, which they should be. About the base game: The start is always the hardest part about most games, especially this one. All you have to do is grind and find ways to make money and have fun at the same time. Modders in multiplayer are a problem, but you can just find a new session.I find this game to be somewhat addictive when you are always making objectives for yourself about what thing you want next (car, tank, office building, etc).Trolls in multiplayer can sometimes give you a laugh, but the ones who just shoot you out of your car for no reason kinda ruin the fun sometimes.This is my honest opinion so far about this game and what has happened in the GTA V Modding community",1.0

"I bought this game on PS3 originally, and then again on Steam. Firstly, the single player is very good, but fall short of the other games in the GTA Franchise. There are many improvements from previous games that are completely removed and if you 100% the game, you will be insanely bored. Secondly, the multiplayer is also lacking despite what it seems. It misses the point of open world fun, instead twisting the game into a microtransaction hell of glitches, hackers, and broken promises. Rockstar lowered the payouts of ALL missions, making it harder to earn money and experience new content. They also have no anti-cheat, so hackers pretty much run the game. So, with the multiplayer being garbage I decided to dwell in single player: This is where the game shined again for me. Mods brought back the single player fun I was used to, but apparently Rockstar is only about money now. Even though thier customers have remained loyal and supported them through countless controversies, they decided to begin threating mod tools and creators, people who loved thier games so much they wanted to add on to them. This behavior is inexcusable. No company should treat fans this way. Rockstar is now one of the companys it used to satirize on the in-game radio. Expect more of this behavior, because GTA V was insanely lucrative and the online brought even more cash.",1.0

"Alright listen, as much as I love the Grand Theft Auto series, and even though I enjoy this game a lot..... I can honestly say with full confidence this game is the epitome of every disease you can think of. The online mode is where this game really shines (or WOULD shine) other than the blockbuster-like story in single player mode, and crazy Trevor of course. But see, that's just the problem..... everybody plays the online mode, but it's so terrible, the community is toxic as f*ck, and the loading screens... for f*cks sake. Hold on, Let me create this list of bullsh*t for you real quick:1. Loading screens take forever.2. One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen, literally feels like you're playing with 9 year old kids. Not even joking.3. Bored players who will constantly f*ck with you and ruin your fun so that you can't get anything done.4. Everything is EXPENSIVE as all hell and it's extremely time consuming to make money, and you can hardly even do that without d*ckheads constantly trying to kill you and blow up your product, which is really stupid because they don't really get much of a reward out of it at all, so it further proves that they just do it to be a d*ck.5. There are HACKERS literally EVERYWHERE in this game, and they will do crazy sh*t such as spawn a ton of money in your account for no reason (which can apparently get you banned, how f*cking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ is that?) or spawn all the players on the map onto a roof top and then blow them all up with a missile.They give ZERO f*cks, and are quite annoying.6. The f*cking loading screens X___X7. You can play a Solo session, or with your friends only.... but you're not allowed to do any actual CEO or MC club work, etc without being in a public session full of d*ckheads, which makes money making almost impossible when you got mother f*ckers flying around in jets trolling everyone, blowing your sh*t up.8. You have to constantly jump from session to session, in hopes that you'll get away from said d*ckheads and can actually get some sh*t done in peace.9. And I mean the community is so toxic, I've never seen so much hostility and name calling in a video game in my life, jesus christ.......... nobody gives a f*ck about anybody or anything in this game. I mean yeah it's GTA, but the people on here get a bit ridiculous most of the time I'll be honest.10. It doesn't matter how big your gang/ crew is, all it takes is one d*ckhead with a rocket launcher or a jet to blow up your plane or truck full of cargo worth hundreds of thousands of dollars that you wasted half your f*cking day trying to make. 11. I'm sure there's a couple more things I missed on this list of bullsh*t but whatever.12. This game almost drove me to the edge of insanity. I'm 27 years old, I don't need this bullsh*t right now, I need to take a break lol.13. I'll come back to it some other time, but if you, the person reading this, plans on buying it and trying it out for the online mode...... then be prepared for all the bullsh*t I just talked about, unless of course you're just some bored 11 year old turd (or grown man for all I know) that wants to get on and troll people, then by all means go right ahead, if that makes you feel better about your life.14. Oh wait, the heists..... man f*ck heists, I'm not waiting 10 years (literally) for players that are level 587 to join the lobby only to suck a** anyways and fail the heists every single time. It's bad enough low level players do which is to be expected, but man when you're that high of a level.... c'mon now. (And yes I'm being serious, though it isn't always this bad, but it can be).15.

"Probably the most important good thing about GTA V is that for its money it offers you more than ANY triple-A game on a market, without necessity to buy DLC's\season passes and other cancerous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.You pay for a complete, decently optimized and good-looking game that can take about 60 hours for a single playtrough. Add some more if you are 100% junkie, my steam says i played for 51 hours and finished 76.5%. And even more if you are willing to play GTA Online which is not THAT great in standart game mods, but might pleasantly surprise you and 3 of your friends in Online Heists mode.Story is a great mix of action-comedy and crime drama genres with not a single moment being wasted. Full of well-written and perfectly-acted characters, beautifully directed cut-scenes and gameplay moments with seamless transitions from one to another, the OST feels right both the official score and radio tracks. Programming and attention to details makes the game-world alive and natural.I can only think of 2 reasons why a person may not like GTA V (assuming this particular person likes video games)1) You just dont play action or open-world games at all.2) You dont like playing as a bunch of bad guys with a necessity of killing cops, federal agents and a military personal.Other than that GTA V is without a doubt the best open-world action game and a commercial product of a great quality and pleasure-per-dollar value.10\10",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is the definition of a love-hate relationship. It's one of those games that would greatly benefit from a ""neutral"" recommendation. This game does a lot of things right, and a  lot  of things wrong. I'll be discussing the single player portion and the online portion in seperate sections, as at this point they are nowhere near the same game anymore.TL;DR at bottom! General The attention to detail throughout the game is absolutely stunning. Puddles are dynamic, people comment on your car as you drive by, cars will have their tires turned into the curb when downhill parking.  It's mad. It's clear that significant amounts of effort when into creating a living, breathing environment for Los Santos. The game is gorgeous. Everywhere you turn there is a beautiful sunset, impressive reflections, and eye-catching, vibrant colors. It's such a breath of fresh air compared to the generic brown/grey colour palette. Luckily, optimization allows GTA V to run as smooth as butter. I've been running the game on a GTX 1060 6GB on ultra high settings, and have been consistently getting a 60-70+ FPS with very few frame drops. Friends with lower end GPUs have reported the same thing to me. This game is widely playable across a lot of systems in my experience.First Person is a welcomed edition from the last gen edition of the game (if anyone still plays those...). Nearly the entire game can be played through in first person, which offers an interesting (and often times challenging) perspective for races, firefights, and roaming the city. Single Player The single player is, and always has been, an amazingly enjoyable experience. It's a lovely blend of gritty, twisted, dark plotlines and absurd, entertaining fun. There are some scenes that were a bit too much for me, ( the Trevor torture scene still keeps me awake at night >_> ) but this all ultimately comes down to personal preference. The character dynamic between Franklin, Micheal, and Trevor is fun to watch unfold throughout your time playing, which could be a while. It took me about 50+ hours to finish the main story, and 90+ hours to 100% it. However, content is limited thanks to Rockstars inability to hear the community's cry for solo content. A lot of people wouldn't mind spending $10, $20 on an expansion for the single player, but Rockstar continues to ignore half of it's game to continue to work on it's cash cow. Grand Theft Auto Online GTA Online sings a tune very different from that of the single player. Online is at best, a hugely entertaining passtime, and at worst, a horrible nightmare to play. The game essentially revolves around completing missions, jobs, heists, etc. in order to acquire large sums of money. You then use this money to buy vehicles, weapons, and property (which often times unlocks new missions, jobs, and heists to play at your disposal). The main problem with this model is that unless you're willing to grind your♥♥♥♥♥off, you're not getting anything quick. As more and more updates come out, the prices of things go up and up, all in a desperate attempt to push Shark Cards (In game currency for real money). What's even worse is that the value of Shark Cards has not kept up with the insane inflation that GTA Online has had over the years. On launch, $1,000,000 was an insane amount of money. Now it's chump change. With every new update comes millions upon millions of dollars you need to spend in order to get anything. The most expensive Shark Card in the game ($99.99 USD) gives you $8,000,000 in game. You  will  burn through that quick. So unless you're ready to spend a LOT of money to get everything you want, you'll be grinding. What adds insult to injury is all of the hackers spawning themselves infinite amounts of money, and all the bans that don't get applied. You'd be lucky not to have some sort of hacker in your lobby. They run rampant, with free rain to kill everyone and everything, and spawn themselves (and you) money. Don't worry, Rockstar will just ban them, right? That'd be nice. Most of the time they do ban waves, they catch thousands of innocent players who have worked hard for their money, and will either take their money or ban them completely from Online. It's entirely innapropriate and Rockstar really needs to work on it. So say you've acquired your money, you've bought some nice things, and now you're enjoying free roam. Prepare to be blasted to hell by one of the most toxic communities I've ever experienced. This game breeds toxicity. People  will  blow up you, your car, your plane, and your will to live. Low leveled players have little to no chance of fighting back, as they don't have sticky bombs, miniguns, or any other of the strong anti-grief weapons. Your only option after that is passive mode, which is no fun whatsoever. Basically, what I'm getting at is Online is a complete nightmare to play alone.  However,  if you and a couple buddies pick up the game and play together, you're in for some of the most fun you'll ever have. Playing races and missions together, away from public lobbies, is the most entertaining thing I've ever played. The most recent update, the Doomsday Heist, reintroduced new PvE content instead of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥, hollow PvP content they've been pushing lately. It's a huge step in the right direction for the future of this game, and if they continue on the path of PvE and co-op I can see this game lasting a lot longer into the future.  I cannot stress it enough: If you plan on getting this game for Online, get it with friends!  TL;DR  Pros:  Amazing single player experience Extremely detailed world Beautiful scenery and environments Impressive optimizations Stupid fun Recent updates for online are a step in the right direction Cons:  Rest in Peace single player content Stupid hard push on Shark Cards One of the most toxic communities I've ever seen Hackers run rampant 24/7 Grind to get anywhereI want to be able to fully recommend this game 100%, but I simply can't. While I do fully recommend it if you plan on playing it with friends, the downsides of playing Online by yourself are staggering. I repeat, if you plan on playing the Online, play it with a couple of friends. You will enjoy your experience exponentially more.",1.0

"The first GTA I've actually enjoyed. Bacause of the first person camera viewpoint but mainly because they've tightened up the driving physics (although the traction is still  like driving on snow (you can travel about 200 metres along the sand on a beached Jetski)) and included a driver's eye-line camera viewpoint (although it does turn into a chest-cam on vehicles like the quad bike).But all told, a really really enjoyable experience.

"I own GTAV on X360, X1, and PC... why am I leaving this bad review? It's not specifically about the anti-modding support... but that's now a big part of it.  My bad review is based on the actual decline of how fun this game has been to me and my friends.On launch, 360, a long♥♥♥♥♥time ago... I went to a launch party, played some gtav with people and came home and actually enjoyed the game offline, and it's still fun offline, but ... i discovered online after the 100% story mode and really had tons of fun with my friends, and then the nerfs and really stupid stuff happened. First it started with nerfing cash payouts for tons of jobs, you used to get 18k on hard mode for blowing up 3 trash trucks that were decently far apart. and raiding a compound... now you get maybe 4k for the entire thing. the weapons/ammo you use costs more than 4k.There was the admittedly cheaty mission where you blew up cars in a parking lot and got a quick 25k, understandable they made it harder... but then nerfed the entire mission to 10k, the car spawned running away and you had to chase it and then take the case and deliver it to martin... all for 10k. 10k honestly will buy you nothing in the game now. Now we have supercars that are 2m+ giant garage's that you have to buy each level of, gang warehouses, all sorts of new content! but ... all the heists and missions don't pay near enough to actually afford these things, you must buy shark cards. Don't get me wrong, I understand shark cards support the game, as I've bought 2-3 of them myself to support the game... but there's a point when it has to stop. I can't enjoy the game because there's so much content that it's impossible to earn enough money for it all just playing normally, and normally meaning not 12 hours a day... The game itself has lots of content, lots of great fun to be had... but the structure is gone, it's no longer fun because of how stupid and difficult it is to earn anything anymore. I only have 55 hours in the PC version of the game simply because all of my friends stopped long ago and no longer play for the exact same reasons. I hope in the future, when the new GTA Online is released, it's not this bad... because reading all the reviews just about mod tools makes you realize one thing, it's not even the mod tools that was the issue per-se... it's the fact said mod tools spawned money, players flocked to these 'modders' because making money in GTA Online is ridiculous now, and the only way to do anything is through modders. There are still tools out there for this... but I just stopped playing because it's impossible to make enough money to do anything anymore, the game is dead, and not even because of the open IV issue....",1.0

"GTA V was an awesome game in it's prime, fun with friends, alone and even with strangers. When I say ""in it's prime"" I mean the classic console versions, not this PC version.Multiplayer:There are many aspects I would talk about like the long long loading screens, or the non existent balancing between high levels and low levels. But the problem that made me stop playing is that the concentration of cheaters is embarrassingly high, I would join a open world server and I would say there's a 50/50 chance to meet a cheater. They would often be invincible, and once in a while the cheater would annihilate EVERYBODY at the same time, which could be up to 30 players depending if the server was full. Sometimes you would get lucky and get a friendly cheater who gives free money, but that ruins the whole point of the game, to earn money by doing jobs and spend it on upgrading your stuff. Now I also hear the game's developer firm - ""Rockstar"" is trying to get rid of cheaters and removing ""illegitimately"" obtained money by going on a banning spree which resulted in innocent players getting banned as well as their in game money. Online GTA on PC is just unplayable.Singleplayer:The singleplayer is what the past GTA games were but better. Big open world to explore with several different environments, long and entertaining story to play through. But this is no where worth the 59.99 $, with that money you can buy two good games like PUB G & CS:GO and still have left over money. I do NOT recommend this game on PC, just stick to the console version.",1.0

"""Julie_Sparkles"" (actual Rockstar Social Club username) is a posh t-wat who doesn't like men that use misogynistic words such as "" b-itch, c-unt, p-ussy and the rest in the public chat of GTA Online session. She is a 24-year old Polish SJW and a feminazi who won't come to your aid if you're beig griefed in a lobby by a 12 year old with a stolen credit card that likes to use thermal vision goggles and use explosive sniper rounds against you. Instead, while you are being in her friends list, she would reject, avoid and embarrass you in front of everyone for being a ""misogynist in chat"". But she will claim to be your best friend without even revealing herself to be a female. So, if you use misogynistic words in chat while she's around, you're a sexist, male-chauvinist a-sshole and it's your fault even though you never knew she was female. 2018 is looking great so far. Well, maybe online gaming has been always like this and I might be experiencing this new form of cancer just today. This game is not the pain for players because of hackers and modders. I believe it's a pain because of SJWs, feminists and LGBT left-wing d-ickheads. Look at Bully Hunters and Battlefield V on YouTube to see how sad the world has become.God Bless those who have been putting up with this pain forever since the very beginning.If you guys wanna see her on Social Club, just look for her name that I have typed in the 1st line.

"Steam says I have 352 hours on GTAV/GTAO. Considering I ported my character over from Xbox 360, it should be at least double that. So lets say 700 hours. I have spent aproximately 700 hours playing this video game.Yet I cannot recommend it. Yes I have had some of the best gaming I've ever had with this game. I thoroughly enjoyed the single player campaign, I played online mostly and had a a character legitimately over level 100 and with a nice sum of money set aside. I even supported the game further with the very occasional shark card. I was there for the DNS glitch that caused 9 billion dollar bounties to occur, and I was there when they cut literally everyone's funds to 500,000 as a ""fix""But one day I was playing and some guy joins the server, forcibly teleports myself and a handful of others to him, freezes us, and makes bags of money rain from the sky. Don't get me wrong, I'm not stupid, I know people hack and people give out money. I've seen countless people ask for them and praise them etc. I've generally ignored them, but this guy didn't give me much of a choice. Regardless once I figured out what was happening I left the server. I didn't want the money in my bank so I blew it customizing street cars and blowing them up. A couple hours later I was temporarily banned and my character was reset. I lost all of my cars, including old ones with rare paint jobs that could only be obtained by an exploit that had been patched, not to mention the majority of that 700 hours I'd put into having a character I liked. Rockstar punished me for something that was thrust upon me. My ingame wallet was♥♥♥♥♥♥♥and they decided to blame the victim.There was no way for me to voice my displeasure to Rockstar. No appeals process for them to hear my case, check the evidence, and see my innocence. That was several months ago. I uninstalled the game and let it go. I'm only writing this now so that others can see what they're getting into. Yes, as I've said, this game is incredibly fun and contains hours upon hours of content. From an objective standpoint, its very good value for money and the free, regular, DLC is a nice touch. What ruins all of that is the way Rockstar treats its customers. There's no consistency, and no compassion. I know people in real life that have been taking free money for ages and they've never had any trouble. Yet it happens to me once, without my consent, and I get temp banned and lose literally everything. What motivation is there to play legitimately then? If people who do can lose everything in an instant with no way to appeal the decision, and those who don't can get away with it indefinitely. Hell you actually get a bonus for playing illegitimately because those people can just make new accounts and hack their way back to wealth and experience. Rockstar, if you actually end up reading this, please start treating your customers with some compassion. Don't assume we're all hackers.",1.0

Rockstar have put a lot of time into releasing it on PC and I'd say it was well worth the wait. Just, the whole needing to be logged into Rockstar Social Club just to be able to play the single player can be a bit of a pain for the casual player.The minimun requirements are a complete lie. Chances are, you will not be able to launch the menu screen without it crashing as well as the in-game video memory calculator. If you have SLI graphics cards at both 2gb, it will tell you that you have about 4gb of video memory, do not trust this and start turning everything to ultra graphics expecting it to run at above 60 fps. That is not how sli works, Rockstar..But, so far, I've not experienced any crashes relating to gameplay, just be wary, that 4GB of RAM should not be used if you want to have a good experience playing as it tends to stutter in open areas with lots of traffic.10/10 -IGN",1.0

ReplayabilityMaybe to see what happens if you go the opposite route in heists. Otherwise there is no reason to play this again. The story was nothing special. Tried online as that seems to be the expectation. Ended up in a team deathmatch with only one person with no FPS skills. That was the most boring 30 minutes I have spent in an online game. Tried a mission. This time at least had four people. We lost almost immediately as the host managed to run himself over with his own car.

DO NOT BUY this stupig game renitialised my character that i worked on for more than 150h just be cause i moded to play around with my friends... It is the bigest pay to win and the only real way to get money in this♥♥♥♥♥♥game is to ether farm or pay hundreds of dollars. Im gonna say this one more time do not buy. So the game removed my 150h of farming because I wanted to have fun... So please dont waste money on this♥♥♥♥♥♥ I also have been banned for modding to give me money for less than an hour (also to play around with my friends). But pepole how mod to annoy players are not banned because rockstar keeps their sweet sweet money and potentially gets more from the players how get killed and want to get better so they buy them money. Players like me how mod just to have fun should not be banned as servrirley and certanly not get their characters reset... Modders how annoy others on the other hand should be banned and not simply be given a warning. ♥♥♥♥ this♥♥♥♥♥♥and ♥♥♥♥ rockstar fot their ♥♥♥♥ing pay to win and not banning pepole how annoy evry one!!!!!!!,1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is an open world action-adventure video game with a single player and multiplayer mode. Sinlge player is great while multiplayer is terrible.At first I loved GTA online, it was fun and there so many new things to do but now online has gone downhill and by downhill I mean hackers keep playing and destroying the game while innocent players (like me) getting banned PERMANENTLY. in addition to all this, if you even try to contact R* support you will get nowhere. This leads me to my next point, R* support is the worst thing you will come across. There is no way you can unbanned if you try to contact them, here let me put it this way, trying to get unbanned via R* support is like trying not to encounter a modder/hacker in your lobby, it's impossible but possible.But minus modders/hackers and R* support, the game offers incredible things aswell. Sinlge player is such a great aspect of GTA it has an amazing campaign which goes on for so long, single player allows you add third-party mods which are stunning and fun at first until you log onto online and get banned. You have three main characters to control with different missions and backgrounds of their lives.Lastly, Online. GTA online is spectacular with friends because you can do races, heists and so much more, but if you have no friends who play online it can be a bit grindy trying to get the new cars and apartments which are extremely expensive like 2mill per car and up to 5mill for a CEO garage. since it can be a bit grindy and some people can be impatient, they all go to modders and ask for money, then all of a sudden money bags come raining from the sky and giving you like 2k per drop (do not ever pick up money bags) also the loading screens needs to improved, it takes like 2mins to be load into online. In online I had reached rank 153 I had everything and had done everything so I was usually mucking around in online or helping friends. But today I got an email saying I was permanently banned, I had no mods installed at all, not even in single player but as the tradition continues R* bans innocent players during the holidays.Overall Grand Theft Auto V is an amazing game for single player which has countless things you can do in it. On the other hand online needs to be improved like the banning, prices and loading screens.Single player: 8.5/10Online:6/10=14.5/20=72.5%",1.0

"This game is by far one of the the best games i have ever played. First of all,the single player campaign is great,it has a great storyline,great characters,great graphics and intriguing short movie scenes in between each mission,the storyline can keep you entertained for hours and if that is not enough,you still have alot of gameplay waiting for you,for example side missions that is unique in every way with fascinating stories behind them,hobbies like golf,racing,diving,trihatlons,skydiving and much more. Not satisfied ?,well there is still online,a place where you and your friends or random people,do the most crazy random♥♥♥♥♥♥create havoc in any kind of way,robbing banks and stores,racing or my personal favourite,deathmatch and alot more.The stuff to do on this game is endless,this game is truly gorgeous,if you want to have a good time, have a lust for adventure or an adrenaline rush,but dont want to leave your basement and go outside and do life,then this is the game for you.10/10",1.0

"My second favourite of the GTA titles. The plot is average, but you witness Franklin, Michael and Trevor's character developments and how they grow throughout the story. Sure, they may be criminals, but it's nice to see their perspective in a game for a change. As for the online mode, it's really a mixed bag. When you're a new player and you start getting into it, going through all the races the first time, completing hard heists with others after struggling and failing multiple times, it's really captivating. However, after a while, to be honest, it gets boring. After you've done it all, stole all the jets from the military base, done all the VIP missions, got revenge against all the tryhards after your newly purchased Buzzard, there's really nothing else to do except replay missions and do the same things. Sure, Rockstar still keeps releasing updates and adding new content, but overall, after each update, it still feels the same. You will enjoy this game a lot when you're playing it for the first time, and even after that for months. But after some time, that joy will slowly and noticeably fade.",0.0

Runs great very well optimized now of course with updated drivers on 7850k.  Now to to the gameplay its honestly the same than on console.  But now including the major texture increase and the ability to play in 4k but where i noticed the biggest increase in from specificly ps3 and ps4 is load times.  I mean WAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYY  faster keep in mind only running of a 7200 rpm drive but i mean the servers for pc are a least in the loading respect they are much better.  For those  experiencing crashing google gta 5 crash fix batch files and you should be able to remedy if not fix the issue at least until rockstar gets its act together.  All in all good game.,1.0

I also have this on the PS4 and the multiplayer environment there is also as bad as it is on the computer, unless you have a group of friends you can form a gang with.

"Singleplayer is a ton of fun, online is a bit different. It is fun, don't get me wrong, but the fact that this is a $60 game with microtransactions for in-game currency is pretty awful and if I were to be honest, pretty dam annoying. They're gonna give you 8 million in-game currency (Which can buy about 2-3 of the fun vehicles) for $100 and think that's a fair deal? The fact they even have these loathed ""shark cards"" in general is frustrating. Rockstar's a great company, so why did they suddenly turn so hungry for even more profit from a game that gave them thousands upon millions of money without these shark cards. And now, to entice players to buy these godawful shark cards, they make the game a grind to get anything you want. You're gonna have to grind and grind to have a little amount of fun. I payed $60 for this game and you want me to pay more? Pathetic.5/10 Would've been a perfect game if Rockstar didn't get greedy.Edit: I should also mention that at times the community can be absolutely abysmal.",1.0

GTA V looks better than those games but does not feel lively. The police and enemy AI is dumb in GTA V. Buy it on sale or something and you will have some good time.The online mode is a grind fest and not for casual games like me. I gave it a shot for almost 80 hours of online play still I am no where and got tired of doing the same crappy jobs over and over so that I can buy some office and warehouse so that I can do those delivery missions over and over until I can buy some other facilities and do their missions over and over. If you have friends you can have some fun but the grind is too much to enjoy. Rockstar deliberately put Artificial Game Lengtheners in the game like elevator animations, warehouse animations, it looks good the first 20 times but then you have to watch it for 200 times with no option to skip it then it gets on your nerves. There are lots of these deliberate game lengtheners, these do not do anything except lengthening the time a player needs to do something which his really annoying.

"I dumped 500 hours into this game to be able to actually make a somewhat ""decent"" review about it. I'll try to cover most things here...Let's start with singleplayer.The story is great, some of the missions are really fun. The story is weird in every way which makes it somewhat fun. Rockstar was making some singleplayer dlcs but they cancelled it so some playerbase left because some of the people that play the game are just here for the singleplayer because that the online has really bad problems I'm gonna mention.Multiplayer.Now this is the big thing for me about gta 5, I'm not a singleplayer type of guy (but I still enjoyed finishing the story) so I focused more on the online. Now all the items' prices were okay until like the Lowriders dlc... I had saved alot of money (well not alot but took me some time) I had saved like 6-7 million gta $ and I was like ""Hey, a new dlc!! let's check it out!"" I looked at the new cars and I was really excited! So I bought me a van to customize it at benny's and went there and made it look neato burrito and then went out to buy another car and customize it and I realize I just spent 3.5m on one single car... I was like ""umm okay its okay y'know we made alot of customizations on it so it's okay"" and then other updates come and the prices keep going higher and the game gets more grindy less than fun... Hackers are everywhere, people asking if there's a modder and when the modder is trolling people some people just go in like ""umm is there a modder in this season? and if there is can i have some money pls? :3"" and it just got annoying. It's like the game lost all its fun.. everyone was as if they're faceless with no personalities almost as if they're like NPCs. Used to have a great time and meet some great friends now it's just all trolling and hacking and really reaaally grindy.. If you want to be able to afford atleast like 3 items in a new dlc nowadays you gotta grind atleast 7.5million to be guaranteed being able to buy atleast 3 items including the property like office or hangar and then there's probably something beside it needed to customize or do stuff with the other items released with the dlc (Workshop or vehicle warehouse) and then there's the one item from the new update (a car, clothing, aircrafts).. It got to the point where if you want to buy a flight suit  you have to pay 50k and if you want a combat helmet you have to pay 100k... That's just too much.. For me it's okay because I have an office and a vehicle warehouse so I can make 100k by selling a top range car from the warehouse but it's still way too grindy for new people.. This is why I do not recommend this.. But if you're here to have some fun with friends I would definitely recommend the game to you. Hangars released with the new update ""Smuggler's Run"" can be a ton of fun with friends. The missions are different and really fun to do. If you like grinding so so much for something then buy this..TL;DR Hackers, stupid people begging for modded money, way too grindy for new players, sometimes fun with friends..",1.0

"The more I play the single player campaign, the more I realize it's just the illusion of choice wrapped up in forced social commentary.

Add that to their controversies with modders and hackers, and it's really tough to recommend this game. That said, the single player campaign isn't so bland it's unplayable, and online can be fun if you have people to play with.

"Edit: 2017/07/08OpenIV is no longer being attacked, allowing some modding, however they have made new rules on mods allowed, one still targeting content of mod (the IP importation specifically, even for other rockstar IP, including prior GTA games). My review still stands, singleplayer needs mods to be fun once its complete (which it really isnt long) and multiplayer is riddled with hackers that dont get banned, and when they do, its often a week-long ban, or rockstar account ban that people avoid by making a new ""social club"" account (which does mean they loose their character, but if they are cheating, thats irrelivent to them). Recently killed off singleplayer modding. can not reccomend with how persistant rockstar is for microtransactions.",1.0

"An obviously, well-deserved 10 out of 10.I've played this game ALOT on the Xbox 360 back in 2013. I loved how endless the game was, how GTA Online would give me the strongest urge to work hard for good-looking sports cars. As a rather ""dedicated"" PC gamer, I chose to wait for the PC version. I'd have my expectaions heighten as each delay was announced. I'm very, very glad to say that this port perfectly lives up to my expectations; a fine, beautiful revisit to Los Santos.It's 100% certain that Rockstar made perfect use of their ""extra time"". I can run this on 60 FPS constantly, on ""Very High"" graphical settings. Despite the major graphical improvements, and the support for rather high-end resolutions, this game can pretty much run on a wide variety of (decent) PC machines.In shorter terms, Grand Theft Auto V on PC is ♥♥♥♥ing optimized. The Rockstar Editor also steps up as the port's new star feature, giving players the opportunity to express their creativity,  and share their experiences. At launch, I experienced some crashes, mostly being Driver crashes, but all that disappeared after a simple restart.What really bothers me though are the rather inevitable  GTA Online connectivity issues. But a couple retries, if not, restarts of the game, let me connect to servers with no problem.This won't affect my view on GTA Online though, for I was always sure it'd happen (again). GTA Online has a wide, wide range of activities to participate in (with friends too!). 100% optimized. 100% fun. 100% worth it. Let's all wait for the mods!",1.0

"Just... Just awful.  I have no idea why this game is so popular.  I tried really hard to like this game, I mean it's GTA, they would have to screw up pretty bad to make it not worth playing.Well they did.  The story is just awful.  The characters, the personalities, the dialog is beyond annoying.  After the first hour I gave up on the story and tried the online game play and it was just not impressed.  They fosused on so much stupid crap and didn't focus on the important things.Two examples.  First 1/2 the time when you get out of your car, your door doesnt close.  So any situation where you need to be; I dont know running, dodging, getting to a new car your door gets in your freaking way and you have to run around it.The other example is buildings.  Want to enter a building with a dozen windows and half a dozen doors?  Well you have to walk around the entire building until you find the only one you can enter.  The main repo building your character works at is almost all windows and doors; yet you have to walk around the entire thing, enter the back room, walk into the front show room (with all the windows and doors) to interact with the characters there.The game is filled with small stupid crap.  Oh you can sit on a couch and smoke pot, and flip through 2 channels, you can play golf, but you can't enter freaking doors!  There are also tons of situations where you are not allowed to run.   Oh a timed mission starts right after a shoot out?  Well for some reason it wont let you run.  Quick their getting away!  Walk casually to your car to high speed chase after them before they get away!",0.0

Being banned from Social Club keeps the devs from playing any of R*'s games even while in singleplayer. Sounds legit, right? At least our friends over in Europe are talking about bringing about lawsuits under the EU's ""Consumer Protection"" laws or something. They're probably just looking for ways to make themselves feel more powerful in the shadow of such a tyrannical corporate threat, but by judging how much Greece has shown up in the news as of late, I'm sure the eastern governments have more problems to deal with than an overbearing company.",0.0
Don't buy this game. Rockstar doesn't want the players to have fun and are only after money. RIP OpenIV.,1.0
"I feel I can only write a review for GTA Online, as Grand theft Auto V has been left in the dust since it launched on PC, All of Rockstar's attention goes into GTA Online now. Buying GTA V is basically just a means of distribution for the Online component.I'm level 99 or something like that, I feel I've played the game long enough to have a solid opinion on it, so let's begin.- Base game hasn't recieved an update since the first weeks of launch, they don't even port Online cars to it anymore. And they have been actively taking steps to prevent people from spawning online cars in singleplayer. Looks like they don't want you trying something before you spend half a million GTAbucks on it only to find you don't like it. - Very few of the updates have added any genuine features or changes, most of the time it's the usual combonation of a new vehicle or two, a gun that no one wants, like the antique pistol for example, and some tacky clothing options.  For an online game that's technically been going for 3 years, there's been very little innovation.- The whole point of the game is to make money so that you can buy toys, and once you've got everything you want, and once you get bored of the missions, adversary modes and races, and get tired of screwing around in freemode, the game becomes pointless, just a never ending quest to buy more and more overpriced cars and clothing for no better reason than to promote your internet ego, and then realize that everyone else in the game is driving Chrome Adders and sitting on golden Yachts- Rockstar doesn't think when it comes to implementing game features, the bad sport system is horribly abused. More often than not I find myself getting ""bad sport points"" for doing nothing else but defending myself against an Armoured Kuruma full of raging teenagers who are killing everyone on sight.  Do that enough and all of a sudden you're broke, and forced to play in a lobby full of dunce hatted griefers and cheaters... not that there's any difference between the dunce lobbies and the normal ones, and on the topic of cheating- The cheating is just insane. it's out of control, Rockstar has lost whatever grip they have on this game, and usually it's not someone cheating in a competitive mode or a co-op mission, more often than not it's just straight out griefing.  Getting C130s dropped on you, cars exploding for no reason, having a gang of stripper NPCs with miniguns spawned on you.  And then you've also got people who spawn moneybags on others, which completely removes any reason for playing legitimately because Rockstar rarely bans, punishes or otherwise goes after anyone who gets hacked money, just the one who spawned it. They slap cheaters on the wrist, often using a strike system, the first 2 or 3 times you're caught, you get banned for a week or two. It should be permanent. There is no excuse for the amount of hacking that goes on in a game of this size- Free roam is a toxic swamp of internet tough guys, racists, griefers, hackers, tryhards, screamers and squeakers. Freeroam was supposed to be the place where you get to show off, and play with all the things you earned during your missions, and you're extremley hard pressed to find a lobby that isn't full of hackers, Raging griefers with tanks, or one with a blood raging argument going on over voice/chat.GTA Online is like one of the seven circles of hell, it's a circle of hell reserved for the morons and half-wits who get off to a toxic, unforgiving and completeley malicious enviornment.It's a shame, because GTA V isn't that bad of a game,  I think GTA IV was ahead of it's time, and I still enjoy it even though it doesn't run too well anymore for some reason.   but GTA V has largely been forgotten since it first launched, because in this industry, if an action game isn't an online game, it's irrelevant.GTA V: An impressive technical achievement, hit some nails on the head, missed some others compared to it's predecessors.GTA Online: A toxic pisshole that should be avoided at all costs.",0.0

A lot of people seem to praise the customization as well, but why?

"After having bought this game on PS3, PS4 and PC, here's the outline of what's going on.Pro's:Fun (mostly)Lots to doCommunity can occasionally be fun (to troll)Cons:Stupidly high amount of hacking kids.Every lobby contains a hacker, 100%, every single time, you can't avoid them.Vote to kick is useless in a full lobby.Cooldown on vote to kick is too long,Report feature is there, but Rockstar pay no attention to it.Cooldown on report feature is too long.They warn you you could break for ToS for reporting someone.Everything is too expensive, like, very expensive. You could say the hackers are the reason for this.Rockstar can't do anything, or are unwilling to do anything about hackers.If you email them directly to report a hacker, you get a generic response to use the ingame report feature.Hackers can unban themselves.Hackers can clear reports about them.Hackers can crash your game.Hackers can control your character.Hackers go undetected as they avoid using the game drivers and files directly.Hackers have the ability to delete your charcater and/or account.Hackers know Rockstar can't do a thing about them.Rockstar do their bans in waves, but by this point, there's already a new mod menu out.Rockstar are about 10 steps behind the hackers.As you see, the cons outweigh the pros, but it's mostly, if not all, down to the amount of hackers.Don't call them modders, that's like trying to say the turd you just dropped is a chocolate log. Clear up the hackers and this game will go back to being fun, until then, avoid this game, and probably safe to avoid GTA 6 when that is released around 2020.",1.0
"Best long running game. GTA will live on forever. MP aspects in 5 are what continues to progess the game. Just make sure to click ""Find new session"" once modders trap you in a steal cage and drop jumbo jets on you.",1.0
"tldr: Everything is great except some longer load times, ""free"" content that practically requires spending money to avoid a massive grind and some minor concerns with griefers/cheaters online.Full Version:If you don't know what GTA is or need a review of the game to decide, you've probably been living under a rock. In short, third person action game with driving, flying, boating and on foot mechanics. Plenty of good here and the environment is expertly crafted with tons of stuff to do. Graphics are solid, story is solid, gameplay is solid. It's a bit of a beast to run, but well worth it.If you are interested in the single player experience, buy it. It's worth it. If you are interested in the multiplayer experience, well... here's the good, the bad and the ugly.The Good:Between online free roam, heists, missions and races, there's something for everyone and the game is tons of fun with a few buddies. The stories that will come out of your online shenanigans are endless.The Bad:Griefing and cheating is fairly common. They've implemented many controls to help cut down on it, but in the end, you'll likely find someone in free roam doing something you don't like. It's not hard to avoid, but if you are the kind of person that likes to just fool around and enjoy things, you might run into some issues. Especially since much of the newer gameplay content requires you to be in public sessions (though you can generally get around that too).The Ugly:The game price is pretty standard fair. The extra content costs are not. Most newer cars and features have in game GTA$ costs. These costs are basically all 6 figures on up, though most are over a million GTA$. Even on sale at $85 for GTA$8,000,000 which is your best deal, that means for ONE new vehicle, it will cost you $10.63. Yes, you can earn GTA$ playing the game and there are numerous guides and tutorials for how to make money ""fast"". Yes, you can find people to hack and give you money (or you can do it yourself) all at the risk of being banned. But for the casual player who doesn't have time to dump hours into grinding boring cargo deliveries or repetitive content, the game makes it unfun and unreasonable to get any newer content. Most games will release DLC packs and new content and charge anywhere from $10-$30 for it. Rockstar has gone to a scheme that amounts to pay to win and made it near impossible for most people to enjoy the online game anymore without shelling out extra cash or resorting to cheats/hacking. The latest content? An orbital laser similar to the Command and Conquer GDI Ion Cannon that costs GTA$900,000 up front and at least GTA$500,000 to fire. Understandable that you want to limit its use to mitigate griefing, but that amounts to $9.56 to purchase the item and $5.31 each time you fire it. Again, yes you can earn money in game and not pay real cash to get there. Yes you want to limit griefing so you don't want someone spamming the ion cannon. However, there are better ways to do that without resorting to such a blatant cash grab. I'd gladly shell out a few bucks for a season pass or a DLC pack, but I'm not dropping $100 to pick up what amounts to basically 1-2 planes/cars. That's unreasonable. This is why I cannot recommend the game anymore.",1.0

"single player? gets too boring unless you use mods. Online? sucks! Rockstar does these stupid schemes to ""Fix Their Game'' and that dosen't help a single bit. Real cheaters don't even get banned so what's the point of ban waves? Rockstar is using  no common sense about what they're doing and i've read more threads about innocent people who just started the game getting banned instead of 100% deliberate, real cheaters. Rip to all those who has been playing since 2014-2015 and got banned for no reason. Rockstar needs to get their head out of their butt and actually realize what's going on with their customers and not meditating on shark cards.",0.0

I'm gonna have to hit this with a negative rating. I loved the story but online is so tedious and time consuming with very little reward.

"I was already pretty annoyed with how Online was being handled, so the recent fiasco with mods really killed this game for me. Let's be honest - this game has been out for a few years now on multiple platforms, so there is a good chance you've played the singleplayer. As fantastic as that is, there isn't a need to buy the game just to play it again, and with mods gone, the only thing to really do is online, which is garbage.",1.0
"I glad hackers are finally getting banned and it's hilarious when they say they got banned for no reason then they say I DON’T HACK and down rate a perfectly good game with a flawless anti-cheat system. So many people crying for no reason it's pathetic! If my friend got banned for hacking and he claimed he didn't hack cos you know hackers always lie. I would save his IP and send it to companies and show he is a hacker so he can't play on psn and stuff, like why do people try to help a hacker get unbanned they can't be a good friend if they a hacker.10/100 full marks, great game recommend to anyone who isn't a hacker!!",1.0

"Before I start this review, I just wanted to state that this game can be enjoyed by ANYONE. It doesn't matter what kind of games you like, you will, without a doubt, enjoy this game. It is so enjoyable, I quit Counter Strike to devote my time and energy earning money to buy explosives and more cars. Let's go over the pros and cons of the game, from my personal experience.PROS-Amazing graphics! It looks like a unicorn♥♥♥♥♥♥all over a pile of gold.-Extremely great FPS! My computer certaintly isn't the best, but I get a solid 60 frames playing this game.-Heists! Robbing a bank requires teamwork and dedication to plan it!-The community is decent. There's really nobody on this game that has called me bad or insulted me heavily.-Missions in general: Have you ever played a game where the missions were a pain in your♥♥♥♥♥ Well, on GTAV, the missions are fun, and quite challenging!-Cars: Somebody blew up your expensive car? Sucks for them, they have to pay for it. There are a great variety of cars that you may choose from, and most are extremely fast! Racers, on my go!-Customization: You can customize your character in millions of ways, from ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Sally, to Sexy Lexy, or even some big black pimp that likes to ♥♥♥♥♥ slap the noobs!Point Of Views: This game can be played in first person or third person! This is a GREAT implementation to the game, and makes it even more enjoyable whilst flying helicopters and whatnot.-The NPC's of the game are hilarious! Lester, I'm talking about you buddy!Now let's go over the downfalls of the game.CONS-Some AMD users get texture glitches whilst looking out of their apartment window, or if it's raining.-Dieing will take a small portion of money from your account. Doesn't seem like a big deal? In GTA, you're bound to die every five minutes.After reviewing all of my personal facts about the game, I feel that it's a game that everyone should at least try once! It is currently a 100 pound gold block on the STEAM marketplace, as the gameplay is like no other game. Don't believe my review? Then check out some more!",1.0

"10/10This game is amazing, this ""PC Port"" is worth every penny I spend on it.I see a lot of negative reviews here and I really don't get why.The performance is amazing, it runs many times better then GTA4 did and it looks astonishing.After playing only a few hours I must admit that Rocktstar did a really good job, on the graphics and the optimization.It may have been delayed a couple of times, the end result is worth all the waiting.Sure there are a couple of people with problems performance wise and the online servers are crowded right now, but this will all pass in the coming weeks.You know the story, the gameplay etc. but most people want to know how this game runs on the PC, and so far it runs excellent, better then any tripple A title I have seen in the last couple of months.I could write a long story on how amazing this game is but I really want to play more at this point:)Thank you rockstar for making this game the experience I could have only dreamed for on the PC.Maybe at some point in the future I will include more info here, for now all I can say is: I recommend this game more then most other games for this price tag, you are missing out on a amazing adventure otherwise.",1.0

I never had a chance to appeal it either, since they refuse said appeals automatically. Knowing this, I can't reccomend this game to anyone. I'm not grinding my character out again.

"So GTA V, in my opinion, is the best GTA we've seen in decades. The single player is by far the best of any GTA game, so good it's award winning outside of the games industry for the character portrayals. Although it's got a lot wrong with it (the entire lobby and loading system) the online is everything we previously hoped for and more. Ontop of this Rockstar has continued to iterate on it over the years since it came out making it better and better.But I can't recommend it to anyone. Because the parent company (Take Two Interactive) are greedy, shady and outright devious sacks of bile.Every single update Rockstar has put together for the game since it was first released, T2I has pushed for changes within it to milk the player base. New vehicles coming in? Buff them and nerf the old ones so played feel compelled to spend to upgrade. This stood out to me most in the most recent update where the APC was released and they nerfed the Rhino. An APC is now tougher than a full on army tank. Because long time players already own the tank, got to motivate them to want the APC instead. What infuriates me about this particular example is the Rhino is a friggen gaming icon. It has been the staple apex weaponised vehicle in GTA since the very first game.The CEO of T2I had this to say last week ""We are convinced that we are probably from an industry view undermonetizing on a per-user basis. There is wood to chop because I think we can do more, and we can do more without interfering with our strategy of being the most creative and our ethical approach, which is delighting consumers.""Well, that last part was bulldonk, because they apparently can't even monetise the games at the current level without compromising their standards.The straw that breaks the camels back is just issued a cease and desist to the biggest core mod in the GTA community. The overwhelming majority of mods run off the back of this mod so they effectively just told the entire modding community that modding is illegal and to stop. To clarify these are single player only mods. That is utter insanity.Modding GTA games on PC is as much as a staple of the series as cars and crime. One of the first games I ever tinkered around with modding was GTA 1. I edited the sprites and tweaked the physics to make bikes into rockets, police cars into UFO's and give everything else a futuristic twist. And it was great fun. GTA is a series that was definitive in the evolution of sandbox games. We played in those sandboxed and as we played we imagined, created, tweaked and built new worlds within the open world sandbox it presented us.GTA V has seen multiple releases and it's no exaggeration to say the majority of the hype for the upcoming PC release was how it would open the doors to modding the game. Many people already owned the console version and repurchased the game simply for modding. There was even an entire program to players to transfer their saves from console to PC the move was so popular. But an enormous chunk of their player base buying the game twice apparently wasn't enough.Take Two Interactive seems to think too many people are enjoying the single player side of GTA V. It's bad enough that despite handfuls of DLC updates the single player has never gotten any new content, it's all online additions only. But now they are cracking down on players creating new content for the single player for themselves. Because people don't spend money on microtransactions for the single player. There is wood on the block left to chop.This is not okay.",1.0

When you're playing online it takes forever to get something done, everything costs way too much to keep a good budget and there are so many ways of raging in the game. I started playing online a few weeks ago, I have my own club and business, got a weed farm and 2 warehouses. The weed farm takes ages to fill (I started it a week ago and it isn't full). And you need to pretty much wait until everybody has left the session to feel safe enough to make deals with the special cargo.

"What's not to love about GTA V? The sheer scale of the game, packed with so much minute detail, it makes the mind boggle with how much effort and co-ordination must have been requried to complete this masterpiece. And it's apparently never complete, with continuous updates for GTA Online. Single player gives you many hours of great story telling and unique experiences. GTA Online is where the beauty of co-operative team play shines. Missions are great, but GTA Online's brilliance is bound by the amazing story driven Heists. Forced co-op where multiple players usually performing different tasks either in pairs or alone, with the succesful outcome dependent on all parties. It's just incredible, occasionally frustrating, and all together great fun. There's some other modes, I've barely played any, I'm sure they could be fun too..",1.0
"Dont get me wrong, its an amazing game both single player and online, but its also one of the most frustrating games i know.

Wether its just simply griefing, forcing you to do things or be places you dont wanna be.... or more recently being able to flag you for the automated ban system. I had the unfortunate luck to run into one such modder and now thanks to Rockstars zero tolerance policy when it comes to bans, all my 250+ hours of progress has been wiped with no chance to appeal.If you do buy this game, research what you are getting into because this game takes a lot of time and while the game is good, its community is one of the most toxic, degrading organisms i have ever had the pleasure to deal with.Cant wait to read the comments on this review saying im a cheater :D",1.0

Turn onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5 mins until smooth. Cover with a tea towel and set aside. You can leave the dough to rise if you like, but it’s not essential for a thin crust.2. Make the sauce: Mix the passata, basil and crushed garlic together, then season to taste. Leave to stand at room temperature while you get on with shaping the base.3. Roll out the dough: If you’ve let the dough rise, give it a quick knead, then split into two balls. On a floured surface, roll out the dough into large rounds, about 25cm across, using a rolling pin. The dough needs to be very thin as it will rise in the oven. Lift the rounds onto two floured baking sheets.4. Top and bake: Heat oven to 240C/fan 220C /gas 8. Put another baking sheet or an upturned baking tray in the oven on the top shelf. Smooth sauce over bases with the back of a spoon. Scatter with cheese and tomatoes, drizzle with olive oil and season. Put one pizza, still on its baking sheet, on top of the preheated sheet or tray. Bake for 8-10 mins until crisp. Serve with a little more olive oil, and basil leaves if using. Repeat step for remaining pizza.",1.0
"There's so much bad stuff I could say about GTA Online. I was actually in the process of writing a long, indepth summary of what happened to this game and what went so wrong. The constant modders ruining multiplayer, the abismal servers that disconnect you every few minutes, unbalanced freeroam, horrible matchmaking. But I scrapped the writing and decided to give it one more shot, one more shot to be the game I remembered and loved. I load in, run around for awhile, then get into what i thought was gonna be a sniper fight. The dude was shooting explosive bullets, I almost went to report him. I google searched explosive sniper bullets in gta. They actually added explosive one-hit bullets to the sniper rifle. It is now essentially a long range hitscan rpg. Im in ♥♥♥♥ing awe of their stupidity. Good bye gta online, you had a good run until about a year ago. Please do not buy this game, don't give them money they don't deserve.",1.0

"I really wanted to dislike this game. I think it was because I'd heard so much about hackers and griefers. After 50 hours I can happily say I love this game. I haven't even played the story mode yet !! I've only played online. Which is a whole game unto itself ! (You can play online on your own by the way) Or you can make a crew and just play with friends. There is so much to do !! You can fly, drive, pilot boats and submarines !! You don't have to pvp. Even if you got grief you can enable passive mode so no one can get you ! The game itself is absolutely stunning visually and runs like a dream. ( I'd also heard it run rubbish by other people) I cannot emphasise enough how good I think this game is. I have just bought a stunning apartment and am working my way up to buying an office so I can run a business and hire people. Then I think I'll splash out on a yacht. You can cruise along at your own pace in this game or you can be busier than a bunny with two ding dongs ! The only fault I have found at all with this game is the loading screens are a bit long, albeit justified because of the amount of stuff to load. Also the interfaces are a bit confusing to start off with but this I think is a necessary evil as there are so many interactive menu's, ie the internet, mobile phone, maps, weapons that you need. I hated this game before I even played it. Now it's my goto game.  11/10",1.0

"BEFORE YOU READ. It seems, that i've choosen a bad time to write an review, because at the moment everybody went crazy about mods situation. This review explains the whole situation, not just the mods one.(This is dedicated straight to the Online part of the game)I've played this game since fall 2015 and been trough 1000+ hours of gameplay. I really got mixed thoughts about this game. It was great at the beginning, but at it's lifetime it just got worse. I'd like to point some things outGameplay:The main idea of the whole gameplay is to become an criminal lord in the Los-Santos. Somewhere around the start of the game there was just contact missions (some folks just told you to go somewhere and shoot somebody ect.) and heists. But invest-money-businesses came after. I would be totally ok with that if some features would be purchasable without buying these ""businesses"" (special transport is a good example).Updates/DLCs:Thanks to Sharkcards donators every update is sort of free. But instead of selling an update as paid DLC, devs just put huge prices making players, which cannot afford some purchases, to donate real life money for in-game money (still better than paid DLC). I know, there are lots of ways to earn money in this game, but every single of them are coming to farming/grinding in conclussion.New content advertisment:Devs have a very interesting way to advert their updates. They just spamming ""BUY IT NOW"" in game tips, in-game phone and in-game email. Well, not literally, but if you're not interested in the new content, you don't have a choice to ignore it. It will annoyingly spam you with offers to buy it in every single way it's possible in this game.Servers:I don't have any ideas about servers quality on other platforms, but on PC they are just bad. Instead of good old server browser for PC platform we get completely random matchmaking system. If you want to join Online you just push one button and jumping straight into the loading screen, which can drop you in Singleplayer after minutes of loading. While loading you don't have any ideas where does matchmaking gonna drop you at. You can't choose where do you wish to go, to the empty or full session. Sometimes game can drop you into the Singleplayer right at the middle of Online gameplay. I didn't even mentioned disasterous server connection - long times to register kills, purchases or NPCs teleporting around.Loadings:As i already told - loadings are one of the main problem of the game. I dont know why this game has huge loading times. I would totally be ok with loadings too, but they're just everywhere. You choose session - loading. You start some gamemode - loading. You wait for a new gamemode round to begin - loading. You start heist/mission - loading. If you're playing with your friends, the game can even throw you around on random sessions sepereting you. And if you want to join up with your friends you have to go trough loadings again.Bugs and glitches:It's not a secret, that this game is filled with bugs, whatever they are abusable or not. Devs are seemed to not be interested in fixing them. At this point i can't understand them in any way. Once devs told that they support community if they're using harmless glitches to have fun (such as getting restricted clothing) and then devs are fixing them. They often got attention on glitches that community using for fun and fixing them, but not when it comes to the real ones such as losing connection, unlimited loadings or server connection problems ect.There is one bug with dissapearing helmets in the game, which devs sure were informed about and not fixing it for almost a year now. This one were the most annoying for me.Modding:Also a tricky part. A good part of the GTA V community is the modding guys. Some of the players are interested in this game because it can serve as a good modding platform (myself included). They're making unlimited amount of nice looking machinimas or artworks. Everything thanks to the mods. But at the time Take-Two are trying to kill modding community by banning some of the modding tools.But not every mod requires some complicated tools. Not some called ""mod menus"". You can often see people using these in Online (mods are actually not allowed in Online, if you're using one, you're risking to get banned). It would be ok if they're were just messing around with themselfes, but often they hurt innocent people by spawning them huge amount of money (which self-called anti-cheat system registers as hacking) and causing ban on both. Or they just can spam kills the whole session. Or even removing your hard earned cash or crashing the game (yes, they can crash your game).Performance:Optimization died with the game lifetime. Now it filled with unneeded sports cars and clothing reskins (which are in low-res for some reason). My PC settings are good enough play this game (even better than recommended), but i often meet with FPS drops or one second freezes now. Not even only me. My friends are suffering these too.Im just trying to say, that huge amount of content are pushing the game engine to the limit. Or something else is causing the troubles, then im not sure.But even if you never actually pay attention to the bad sides of the game, you can still have fun in it, since this game is sure has good something to offer to you. I wouldn't play this game for 1000+ hours if there wasn't any fun of it. This game granted me tons of good memories.TL;DR-Donate or you're left to farm money to enjoy new updates.-Poor server connection implementation.-Bugs are never getting fixed.-Ban risk.-Performance troubles.-Still possible to enjoy the game if you ignore every single problem.-Not recommended to buy at current state.",0.0

"I really don't know what to think of this game. So I'll just break it down.Is it fun? Sure. Better with friends of course if you're playing multiplayer. Heists are pretty fun, arguably has some of the best racing gameplay even amongst racing games, shooting is simplistic but satisfying, character movement is very awkward and clunky, you will always move a little too far or too little or perhaps in the wrong direction of what you were aiming for, I personally found it a nightmare to deal with. Air vehicle combat is a bit messy as are some controls for a few of them.The game itself is very hard to have fun in if you have no money and are a low level, since most weapons and upgrades have level requirements. Ontop of most ""fun"" vehicles being very expensive and unless you spend an entire day grinding with high level friends who will carry you through heists, you will not be able to afford anything.Does it run well?For a port, I guess. Lots of stuttering when moving quickly, incredibly long load times even with an SSD. Constant lobby connection issues, constant issues in minigames, constant saving issues, constant glitches in heists. Singleplayer runs alright I guess, probably because it doesn't have to deal with R's crappy servers as much. So to sum up, No.Are there a lot of modders/hackers? Oh absolutely. Though I will say, this game has far more modders than people give it credit, it's just not all modders are the ones actively trying to ruin your day. I'd be very surprised if there were many people over level 120 in a lobby who actually obtained that level entirely through their own volition by grinding. Or perhaps it's some level 30 with an Office, Hangar, Bunker, Facility doing bombing runs with their maxed out Avenger then jumping out in their maxed X-80. You get the idea.Do I recommend this game?No. I can't recommend this game. I've had fun with it, but the amount of times I haven't far outweighs those experiences. From all the connectivity problems, the in-game performance issues, the copy&paste of a lot of its content, the constant mindless cashgrab vehicle updates, R's lack of care about anything other than money, constant distruptive modders who have nothing better to do other than spawn cages or go invincible and kill everyone in the lobby, the complete mindless grind that this game is if you don't spend hundreds of dollars on in-game cash and to top it off the awful anti-cheat. It is not only letting modders get away with pretty much anything (you would not believe the stuff I've seen, reported and nothing come of it) but if a modder spams RP or money onto you, YOU are the one who is banned. I have been banned Twice, I've never been able to get over level 100 because of this and I'm just exhausted.If you want this game even despite all this, maybe your friends are egging you on to buy it, wait until it's at the very lowest sale price because it is without a doubt, not worth this price.",1.0
"GTA V was an amazing game back when it was released. It had amazing story, really good graphics, spot on voice acting and amazing humor and critic about modern society. The Online part was really good also, I had hours on this part when they first introduced the ""heist"", an extension of the center mechanic in the Story. They where challenging with a few really hard parts, but after a while you could easily finish them even with strangers. Then they introduced jobs and missions, something you could do to earn extra cash and XP relatively easy and had a bit of fun in the proccess. The content was also free, new cars, weapons, clothes, etc. that you could use in the offline Story if you wanted. All was well untill 2 years ago. 2 years ago marked, for me at least, the downfall of the GTA V. In that time they stopped releasing updates for the offline mode, all the content now is locked in the Online part only, leaving you with no way of ""testing"" or using any of it for your story which you had the power to make ""movies"" or short clips while having zero risk of losing in-game money since you could reverse the save if you wanted. Also, the price for the vehicles and their upgrades, started to increase exponentially, for example one car now might cost 50k in-game money (low-riders or special sports cars and vans), but if you want to fully upgrade it you need to spent another 500k minimum so you can ""customize"" it's chassy so it can accept the new upgrades. With every update they increased the price for everything, from buildings to vehicles. They also increased the difficulty in every heist, mission, job, race, etc. The matchmaking became non-existent and low level players where paired with level 120 and up, effectivly ruining the game for new players that wanted to gain money and XP efficiently. The pay-outs also became a joke, finishing a 20 minute team brawl awarding to top players only 2000 at best. Also they stopped carring about cheaters that cheat anything except money. I can log in a server and instantly teleported to the beach for example, so the cheater just kill me because he disabled my weapons, or I crouse around and a giant airplane just materialise out of nowhere. Further more, players that have money and bought pretty much everything in the game, just cruise around, killing other players that try to make some cash, because every job, except social events that get a pass because that was their role, is publicly shown in the map and the game urges you to go and kill those players so you will be awarded for it, effectivly rewarding players ruining the game for others. All of this is a clever manipulation so you would buy the so called Sharkcards. When they first introduced them in the Online, I didn't gave them much thought because the ways you could earn money where pretty solid and fun if you had the time and skills, but now ? Now they finally showed their true face. They didn't force them on us, because they knew that there would be a backlash, so they padded their time, releasing ""free"" content so we won't think too much of it and from personal experience, I fell for it. Had I known back then that this is what the game would become, I would had rented it for the Story only and bought it after a hefty price drop, another part that infuriates me. The game is almost 5 years old 2K, drop the price in half already for other people to buy it.So no, unless they slash the price in half, don't buy it and especially don't buy it for it's Online part, it doesn't worth either your time or your money.",1.0
"Unfortunately, with almost 700 hours, and watching how Rockstar has handled the recent banning issue, I can't see any reason anyone should support them.While I personally wasn't banned, my brother and a few friends were, however.

Great game well ported from Console to PC BUT are you a one of those Gamers like me that waited 2 years to play this game just for the mods because the modding community is awesome ! Yeah unfortunately RockStar because they are so cool and love the PC community they decited to banned anyone who users Mods Online and also Single Player !   So basically RockStar is forcing you to how you should play the game and if you dont Oops time to activate the banning button !                             Rockstar i payed 60 $ for this game even though its the same♥♥♥♥♥game that came out back in 2013 and then came out again in 2014. I expect to have the ability to do whayever the heck i wanna do with the copy. What happens if I scratch my♥♥♥♥♥with my OWN Gta V copy ? Will i get arrested ??    I payed for it meaning i can do whatever the f*ck i want with the product.                           I feel like im just renting this game and not having 100% for myself and I.   What happened to buy and then do whatever you want withv the product....                  So because this game cost 60 $ and its the same game that you played back in September 2013 you ll get pretty bored pretty fast because one the story is short if you take your time to it and its not even as good as the Campaing in GTA 4 which was far more better then this one. Without the mods this game you ll get bored pretty fast that i can promise you.,1.0

"My account was suspended cause some cheater dropped money where i was standing. I had only been playing the game for 3 days and didn't know what was happening I was given a 30 day suspension, then once the suspension was lifted, I was playing with one of our friends and just doing missions. I was doing nothing wrong when it comes to games like that. We were literally following the game content missions. There is no point to cheat an risk being banned yet low an behold i was banned permanently for playing their game. So i call the Support number (1-866-922-8694) after a 20 to 30 mins wait finally get to talk to someone, as soon as she saw the ban she started talking over me and reading me that email they send out when banned/suspended. I'm sitting there trying to tell her just hold on, i want to talk to you. She wouldn't listen she just kept repeating the email. What does she do? She hangs up on me! 	We called back and requested to speak to a supervisor who was kind enough to listen to what we had to say and did apologize for the prior agents actions. She basically said she couldn't do anything to help but submit a ticket for us, in which an email would be received confirming this. An email was received but the ticket number provided and the link provided to get to the ticket were invalid. When you click the link to go to the ticket the page it brings up says ""Uh Oh. The page you requested does not exist"". In the email we received as a so called confirmation of the ticket being created said that there would be a follow up email and any replies to the original email would be added as comments to your ticket. We did add several replies after finding further information from other customer complaints. But the follow up email was never received. We did inform them, in one of the replies to the original email, that the link provided for the ticket did not work and stated the ticket didn't exist (providing the link). This was 1 week from yesterday and still no word from Rockstar Games. This is VERY POOR customer service and they seem to be scamming people out of their hard earned money.		We did learn through other customers' experiences that programs such as CCleaner, Discord Voice Chat, and Active Monitoring Software could trigger being flagged as a cheater/hacker. I use the programs like CCleaner and Active Monitoring software to keep my computer clean and running up to par. Discord Voice chat is just a voice chat program used to literally just talk to friends or other gamers. We have went through the terms and conditions and the EULA, which state nothing to warn you not to use programs like this. Besides a company cannot or shouldn't be able to tell you how to operate your own personal devices in regards to your own security. 	What really gets under my skin with all this is the first time I was suspended I only got to play online for 3 days, then when the 30 day suspension was lifted I got to play another 3 days. Then I was  permanently banned. I didn't modify any of the game data, mod or cheat in any way. I was literally running missions back to back with a friend and we both were using Discord Voice Chat Client. Yet I was the only one that was banned. So, if you use any of these programs and play Gta Online - Be careful you may end up banned as well! We have actually looked on the BBB site on this topic against Rockstar Games there were close to 200 tickets against them for this very thing.",0.0
"GTA V is essentially two games. There's singleplayer, which is alright for a few hours of fun, and then there's online, which is completely broken and unplayable. Across both, the driving and exploration is fun, the selection of cars are cool, and even if gimmicky I have to give due credit to the enormous array of mini-games and random side content that a lot of games are lacking these days. In particular, the radio's commercials and announcements are a treasure trove of quality comedy entertainment. That said, these simpler things that keep you satisfied for a short time are what might earn my recommendation for a $20 game, not a $60 one.Specifically for each mode:Story mode, or singleplayer, follows three characters. One is bland, one is very well developed and somewhat likeable, and the other is just stupid. It seems like the writers went to great lengths to continuously push Trevor's psychopathy past the limits of coherence to prove how edgy he is, and considering his awful babble is present in over a third of the game, it puts you off pretty fast. I don't mean that he's offensive and crude (though more on that if you read on), he's just poorly written and comes across as what a 12 year old wannabe bully with no real concept of the world thinks is the ideal alpha male. Constant insults and forced innuendo that don't even make sense toward his loyal (for some reason) goons, lack of any perceivable motive or personality besides trying to be hardcore, and subpar acting are just the surface. It would not be too much further a stretch for parnetheses to show up on your screen whenever he appears that say ""Please remember player, this man is edgy."", the game tries so hard to get this idea across. He's hardly the only one either, as Franklin's compadres in his side of the story drive it from average to ridiculous and juvenile in short order as well with similar lack of any real personality. The third character Michael's genuinely interesting story was enough to keep me engaged for a while, but the final straw for this game's story came for me when a government official enlists the help of a random stranger he doesn't know (Trevor) to help him torture some guy in a warehouse for information he probably doesn't have. Not the worst story arc in itself, but the fact you must play through this in graphic detail as you waterboard, shock, and maim someone confirmed in my mind that Rockstar has put aside their past approach of making a good game that might unfortunately come across as offensive to some, in favor of making an intentionally offensive game that accidentally might be good. The hype and the sales this game has when it essentially boils down to a fluffed shock value gag is unreal. I'll take a page from their book and make sure there's no ambiguity with what I'm trying to say: the story is trash.Multiplayer could have been fun, as the positive elements of the game mixed with friends seemed like it had a lot of potential. Within a few minutes of joining a lobby however, I witnessed a hacker infinikill someone who apparently♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥him off while two other players casually discussed in the public chat which script menus they were using and that the two week ban one of them just returned from was such a drag. I have been playing games online consistently for years across many systems and have only ever once, up until that point, personally encountered a hacker/scripter. That was in an alpha for an indie game that cost $10. This AAA title managed to triple that number in half an hour. They say no mods online, but they clearly don't put much effort into enforcing it. It's one of the most purchased games on Steam, so I guess they've just said ""Who cares?"" at this point and have called it a success.Just skip this game.",0.0

One of the reasons am still playing this game is its driving is fantastic. Going back to many racing car games or even saint row nothing beats GTA driving. Something about it gives a satisfying gameplay experience. The only reason I'm disliking this game in its current state is the community is toxic. There are hackers around ever corner that think they are that cool blowing everyone up all at once non stop. The problem also is rockstar bans people extremely easy even if a player didn't do anything, but they aren't able to ban hackers properly. The thing that gets me also is this is a game that was released in 2013 on consoles then released on pc in 2015 and they still sell it for a ridiculous price. WHATEVER YOU DO, DO NOT BUY SHARKCARDS. Rockstar is trying to rip you off squeezing money into there pockets. I have bought 1 in my time playing this game and I regret it a lot. There are many strategies to make money many millions.I'm not completely saying its a bad game I still play it lots and I do still recommend it. JUST BUY IT ON A SALE. One of my most played games even. JUST be cautious do not buy sharkcards and don't do anything stupid like banking modded money.",1.0
"Having played on PS3, PS4 and now the PC, I can happily say this version of GTAV is the best of the three, while it doesn't add anything new in the PC version, the mouse and keyboard controls make a major difference.The extra detail present in the textures, as well as the editing suite make this the definitive version of the game, the Director mode leaves a fair bit to be desired though, it would be nice to be able to edit clips to add in more stuff to layer in some more detail, can't film shooting down a buzzard without someone being there to be the guy that gets shot down for instance, and ontop of that, It would be nice to use crewmates characters in the director mode.But all these small gripes are nothing compared to the quality of this port, it would appear Rockstar Games have learned from their mistakes and given us a port we are massively satisfied with.UPDATE: So, many content packs have been released for the game, enough to warrant an update to this review.The Jet finally has an achilles heel in the new Gunrunning DLC, and while this is great, we've been given a new fresh hell in the Mobile Operating Base, as all it takes is a team to set it up in an area where players are likely going to have little room to manovir, and you can endlessly spawncamp them.We've yet to find a counter to it, but I'm sure one will be discovered soon enough.ADDENDUMI cannot abide Take-Two Interactive's assault on the modding community, but I'm not going to allow the company's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ practices to cloud my review of a fairly decent game.8/10",1.0
"Grand Theft Auto V is one of the best and most entertaining games of all time in my opinion. The game is well-optimized and the graphics are great. Online can be a bit of a ♥♥♥♥♥ though due to hackers, but as long as you have some friends to play with, it's still an extremely experience. The story mode is very fun and there is always lots to do. The same can be said for online. Rockstar is also continuing to update the game with mostly fun DLC's such as Heists and Lowriders but we are still waiting to recieve a singleplayer expansion. You can also use the Rockstar Editor mode to record clips and you can edit movies or you can take really nice screenshots. The flying controls are a little weird though because it uses the numpad by default but it can be remapped to the mouse if you so desire. I would recommend having a controller for driving or operating vehicles. The first person mode is a nice touch if you like fps or want to feel more immersed in the game. If you want to take a break from the campaign, there are various ""Strangers and Freaks"" and other entertaining side activities to boost your characters stats.Overall I give this a 10/10It has a huge map that is full of life and a very strong campaign with lots to do. You will most likely never get bored of this game and it is sometimes hard to put is down. Would recommend to evryone who wants to have a really amazing time with or without friends",1.0

The greed of the devs is undeniable, everything new costs millions of in game dollars, and getting those is a real grind. The quick alternative is to buy the infamous shark cards - with real money of course. Additionally some of the new content is simply too much “kids with adhd” for me. Flying cars with rockets and machine guns is simply too much for me to handle.I’m sure you can still have some fun with this game, but sadly - I am no longer part of the GTA V community",1.0

"Let me just say this before I get started, if you're looking for a good game, then you've found it, go buy it now. If you need more information then let me tell you. I personally across all platforms (PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) have about 13,000 hours. It is a beautiful game with a huge community and regular free dlc updates, which keeps this game alive.Lets talk about the graphics, this game no matter where you are in game will keep a solid 60 frames at high settings at 1080p on most modern cards, thats without mods, but little to say this game is very optimized, and runs great. That should be expected of a 4 year old game, but still for how large the game is and how many tiny details there are, its pretty impressive to say the least.The story is really great, its fun and the characters have some depth. Its a pretty basic, easy to follow story with some pretty good characters such as Trevor. The story is pretty easy (except for the mother ♥♥♥♥ing yoga mission) and very enjoyable, once you have finnished the story, there is tons of content to explore, not to mention the massive library of mods to further the time put into this game.One of this games strengths, is its weaknesses. That is that this game is now on PC. If you don't understand what I'm getting at, its that while on the right hand you have impressive graphics and high frame rate, on the other you have modders in the online scene. This can be a make it or break it situation since, this game amassed a huge following through its online servers. For the most part the anti-cheat is ok, but if you run into modders, most of the time its gonna mean no fun.Get the game, its worth it, put the modders aside and you have an amazingly fine tuned beautiful game.",1.0
"I have this game on both PC and Playstation 4.I have spent triple my steam hours on this game in total.Was it worth it? Single player yes, GTA Online not so much.At first when the basic Heist were released making money and buying things in this game was relatively fair.But *ALL* new GTA Online DLC content has *Free-to-Play* priceing. Everything is extreemly expensive.It could take far over 100 Hours to get a yaht. As of writing this I have 112 Hours and im nowhere close to affording it.On PS4? Still no. Probably 200 Hours on there and im still pretty much broke. I only spent money on getting a high end apartment and just a few vehicles to help me make more money.All new vehicles price points are insane. All the best stuff can take over 200 Hours to get one of it.Heck, they added a Glider to the game. I saw a real one on the internet for $2,000. The one in GTA costs $665,000...Now you might be saying ""well maybe you make so much money they have to raise the price."". No.It took me around 10 Hours to get *almost* enough for that vehicle when working for CEOs. And yes the Glider is useless, there are vehicles with 4 seats and are bullet-proof for the same price that came with the basic Heist DLC when the game was fun. This just goes to show how much they jacked the prices on all new stuff.Everything new is built around Shark-Cards (AKA Microtransactions).What about the new Heist they just added? Does it help you make good money?I dont know. I cant play it as the Host. You know why? Cause I have to pay over $1Mill to Host it. I dont have $1Mill.I was actually willing to put up with a little grinding to get it but all of my friends arnt interested in playing this game anymore because of how hard it is to get new stuff.GTA Online looks so fun when Youtubers play it. But when you play it for yourself its a whole other game.Why? Cause they can afford Shark-Cards. They can buy anything they want. They can play the game without grinding.This is also why a big portion of people hack GTA Online, cause for many people its boring without hacks. Much less people would hack money, if they could get money without hacking.Hacking and buying your way through is the only good way to have fun anymore.I hope that Rockstar would fix this, or atleast not hurt their new titles with this same marketing choice.If its so bad then why isnt the entire comunity freaking out like the EA situation? Because GTA is old and the only people left are people who like grinding, or have the money to buy their way into fun stuff. Meaning theres not alot of people left to complain.",1.0

"Update:I got my account back, but many of my friends are not. It's still frustrating as you can see lot of modder / cheater in the public sessions, and you HAVE TO use public sessions to do business and to earn the big bucks.The Story line is great and the online missions and businesses are nice too, but all these restrictions that forces you to public sessions with griefers and/or modders are making the online part painful.Years of clean playing, ginding, then in one morning you see an email from R* aaaand it's gone.The so-called support only says you're banned, your character is reset and there is no way you can appeal.The Story mode is good, the online was fun when there were no modder in the session who just blow you up for fun, or ignite you, you change session, you're still on fire, have to restart game, etc. And after all that YOU ARE THE ONE BANNED.It's been 4 days now, and no useful answer or any reaction, and there are less and less hope for the lift of the unjustified ban.Don't buy the game, it will take your precious time, it will force you to buy the shark cards, then it will take away all your progress just like that and provide you  just a BS, copy paste answer.",1.0

"I should note that OpenIV, the main thing that caused this review to be written, has had it's Cease and Desist notion backed away, so I guess it is back and running? Not too sure, take a look for yourself.Right, I believe I should post a review about the game, considering the recent controversy that has put GTA in a bit of a spotlight, this time negative imstead of positive.As folks know already, the modding tool OpenIV has recieved a Cease and Desist notice, essentially terminating Singleplayer modifications (Important note: Singleplayer)This essentially makes the singleplayer component of the game stuck with essentially the same old same old, that being the same game with the same protagonists with the same you know already. No room for customization like that Rick Sanchez mod that was a thing.I will admit, it has been noted that Modding was not exactly a welcome sight, due to Take Two (Mostly them) and their concern that Singleplayer modding would leak in to their Online portion. Something that was pretty much impossible with OpenIV as it was not designed to cheat in the game.So of course that is the whole backlash thing. I guess I can also talk about the game, since this is a review after all:Singleplayer: Everyone and their amoeba probably know what the singleplayer is about at this point in time, so no need to talk about it. Except that it used to have extensive modification options, but not really now.Multiplayer: Something that is literary the only reason most people play the game for, except some people still on the Singleplayer (Because honestly, SP is still a pretty solid story to play through), as it is the main thing that is being supported by the developers. Although I would say that ovee time, it started from what sounded like a good time in to a game of ""Whoever has the biggest gun"". I started it off as a street urchin, and I gotta say it was pretty exciting, but now that my character is quite a high level, I feel like it is no longer a fun game, but more of a slog of ""Eh, another day, another dude with a fighter jet nuking me"".Not to mention that hackers/cheaters are also quite frequent, folks running scripts that make them immirtal, make money drops or just screw with people. It is something that is simply not fun.This was written on a quick notice, so some things might sound a bit odd, so there's that.Anyway, would I recommend the game? For the singleplayer, I would say yes as it is a pretty solid experience. For Multiplayer? I would say no because it is a dismal place that multiplayer, where you are forced to either grind for a long time to get somewhere, or spend hundreds of your money to get something nice and pretty. Not to mention Take Two's controversy being a sore thing.Overall: No, I wouldn't say that the game should be purchased.",1.0

"I used to be able to recommend this game, but as of now i simply cant, Rockstar ruined their game by making everything so exepensive you have to be a cheater or a kid with your moms credit card to progress in the game, when I first got this game everthing seemed fair, you could get the top tier apartments for around 200k and make quite alot of money by doing heists. But now the game isnt fun anymore since everything costs millions upon millions, (at least the stuff you want like flying cars with machineguns) and all of your income sources have been nerfed. This leaves you to a) cheat or b) buy shark cards.",1.0
"Bottom line: Do not pay more than 50% retail price. (Around £20, €22, $26 - I don't really know the specific prices and this from the retail price as of 22 August 2017)Why you ask? Well that's because only singleplayer is really worth it. Multiplayer is fun for some time, but then you have to grind for hours on the same mission with random people who are completely unreliable - you will rarely find a good team by chance. You may also have friends, but chances are they aren't around to play all the time. In addition, multiplayer is riddled with microtransactions that are designed around the vehicles and such. So if you seriously want to play GTA online, then you'll probably end up paying more money if you don't want to spend hours grinding on the same missions for hours.So it can be said that the reason behind the no more than 50% buying price advice is that only 50% of the game is worth it. To be honest, half the game isn't even the singleplayer. Multiplayer locks off so much content which you simply can't get in the singleplayer without modding - this clearly will ruin immersion too and sense of accomplishment too. If you have friends to play it with, you can go ahead and get it but you'll get bored soon without dishing out hundreds of dollars into microtransactions.I wouldn't recommend this game at full price, but if someone were to want to buy it at half price they might as well - hopefully then they will see that it wouldn't have been worth the full price.",1.0
"Purchased almost exclusively for modding. However, its capability and community support has now been extremely hampered due to the game developer's parent company; the threatening legal action Take-Two imposed on the developers of a GTA modding backbone (OpenIV) was generally unjustified, and Rockstar's later statement on the situation was poor. This all results in reduced longevity for the singeplayer mode.",0.0

However, they decided to do the opposite of that, and attacked (and effectively destroyed) their own modding community, and the only worthwhile thing to do in this game.",0.0
Shark Cards ruined this game. It was great back in the day but now it seems like Take2 and R* just don't want any of their customers to enjoy the game without forking over a ton of cash for the microtransactions. They hiked up the prices on pretty much everything and it takes weeks of grinding just to get a few cars... Or you could buy a $20 Shark Card and get it now!!! Removing mods is the straw that broke the camel's back. Completely taking away the last bastion of hope we had for this game. I cannot recommend this game to anyone at all.,1.0
GTA 5 I bought this game for the online cause ♥♥♥♥ doing story mode.Im sure the story is good though. Only downside about this game really is loadtimes.I mean if you are into gta this is for sure the best Gta out of em all.You will deal with a modder every now and them.This game is a Blast if playing with friends. I'd give this game a 8. 7/10It's for sure worth its full price but you should wait till its on sale since this game is always going on sale.,1.0
"The singleplayer was great, but the multiplayer is a boring grind to get enough money to actually do anything, as well as having to constantly hop between servers to avoid hackersWith the C&D sent to OpenIV, taking away the ability to mod the singleplayer is effectively killing the game for a lot of people. For a game that has been released on 3 different platforms, and is one of the best-selling games out there, you’d have thought R* and Take-Two would be happy with what they accomplished!Edit: Even with OpenIV back, the game is still a representation of what the gaming industry has become; pay to win (or grind a lot for little reward)Although the game can be fun, it is not worth it at full price",1.0

"UPDATE: I am never buying a game with Take Two's name on it again.  OpenIV is a perfectly acceptable SINGLE PLAYER mod, but Take Two has shut it down. Rather than try to solve problems caused by toxic multiplayer mods, the company chose to attack the mod that added the greatest value to their game. So disappointing, which describes pretty much every action that Take Two does.Singleplayer is extremely well-done.  Most flaws from GTA4 have been fixed.  First person mode is a really cool addition and it's a neat novelty to have while playing.  It almost changes the entire game when you use it.Multiplayer, however, is a case study of how to take a near-perfect formula and absolutely ruin it.  In honesty, I usually have fun with the multiplayer, but it causes enough headaches that I can't play for too long at once.  MODDERS.  They do it by installing a simple program.  It's not hard, in fact, it's insanely easy.  Then they get online and essentially bully people.  I don't think there's been a single day I've owned this game in which my play session wasn't (at some point) ruined by modders.  I've had times that I would spawn and instantly be blown up.  Respawn, instant blown up.  I had to force quit the game because I would die so quickly each time that I couldn't get to the pause menu to find a new session.  I've been driving on the road with friends, ready to have some fun, maybe steal a jet from the fort, get equipped and take time to get health up, and my car would explode.  No reason, just a modder wanting to mess with people. Griefers are the least of your worries.  You can at least fight back with those guys, or set yourself to passive mode to get away.   Modders are unavoidable and everywhere.  I have met nice modders who offer me millions of GTA dollars and nice cars, but it's heavily outweighed by the people who get there fix by watching the chat box flair up with anger from people playing fair.  Other devs/publishers have the same issues, but at least they care to update games with solutions to these issues.I can't believe that Rockstar and Take Two care so little that they just leave the game in this condition.  Actually, they even have the audacity to offer Shark Cards so people can spend even more money just to have their expensive in-game vehicles blown up by a modder.  It's simply fascinating how this has been unsolved for so long.  Modders take everything that makes multiplayer work and they just ruin it.  You can have fun for a while but unless you have a group of friends in a private server, be prepared to die for no reason and lose whatever vehicle you're driving.I'd love to be able to write a review that talks about how the guns are cool, vehicle customization is fun and individualizes your vehicles to your own tastes, the character's clothes offer thousands of options to be the character you want... but nope, I don't think it's worth going into while the online is such a mess.  Some of the missions are sloppily designed, the matchmaking could still use a ton of work, and the menus are a pain to learn/navigate.  Controls can be wonky sometimes and they can be difficult to learn if you're playing with mouse/keyboard.If you only want to play singleplayer, you should enjoy it.  If you're like me and only bought this for the online, I think you should pass.  It's too disappointing.",1.0

It's unplayable and boring. Everyone just rushes the armored Kurama car and rolls with it extensivelly. Yes, good idea. A game entirely about shooting things, put into it a fast and manuverable car that's immune to bullets but allows the people inside to shoot outside, paradoxically. Without fear of retaliation.

"The game used to be fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the game but as time passed on the fun faded away replaced with un-happiness. The game has become more and more unplayable throughout the years through the adding of new vehicles and weapons being released at ridiculous prices that force you to purchase shark cards which shouldn't even exist, however as many others think this they have resorted to the next best thing, modding, I without fail will see at least one - two modders per play session. These modders come in all shapes and forms but the most common and the most rampant is the 'Game Ruiner' their purpose for playing with mods is to solely to ruin the game for others this has been going on for some time now, however I have come to realise it will not get better but only continue to get worse. This is why I do not recommend this game to others.",1.0

Banning mods that change the online experience in public servers is absolutely fine. What isn't fine is destroying the only replayability of the single player experience. I and many others would spend hours on end tuning and tweaking the single player segment for our own enjoyment. Many talented modders have just been thrown in the trash because of you guys. Lots of people including myself very much dislike GTA Online because you can't progress without putting a damn mortgage on your house or grinding for a year straight.

"I'd held off on leaving a negative review due to the excellent moddable singleplayer, but now we're stuck with vanilla sp for the forseeable It's time to vent about the dreadful online experience.From as early as a fortnight after release to present day (with a few very brief moments of respite after major updates) the online portion of this game has been absoloutely rife with cheaters to the point of unplayability. GTA online uses an easily exploitable peer to peer network model similar to the call of duty series where the players client is trusted for pretty much all data such as position, amount of health, weapon damage, vehicle speed... you get the idea. This gives those with the ability to inject nefarious code unprecedented control over other players such as the ability to freeze you in place, or spawn objects in your field of view that will cause your game to crash.It also has an mmo-lite style progression system and a focus on grinding, with the idea that those willing to put in the most work will rise to the top and become crime bosses acting as anchorpoints for a lot of the freeroam sandbox gameplay (buying/selling shipments of various illegal products, pve encounters and inter organizational gang wars) while those newer to the game can tag along as muscle and earn enough to eventually set themselves up as a big boss, whether that be a sharply dressed CEO, a grimy biker gang president, a cut and shut stolen car dealer, an arms dealer or any combination of the above. Unfortunately, the games currency is easily hacked and a combination of basic human nature (everyone wants to be the boss after all, and why specialize when you can have everything?) and take2's ludicrous ingame pricing of items and miserly pricing of 'shark cards' (a way to purchase digital currency for real world cash) have created a fertile black market for third parties selling tools to hack the game. Youtube has provided the marketing and the end result is its almost impossible to play the game as the developers originally intended on this platform.The game's recent updates are designed around groups of players competing to buy and sell various types of cargo around the game world and theres a certain thrill in fending off a rival organization to make a sucessful sale. What's far more likely though is you'll be pulled from your vehicle and exploded remotely or teleported to an unkillable player and shot dead, losing your progress. At its worst, (usually immediately following the update of a well known mod menu) every 32 player session has a minimum of five cheaters running mod menus and the vast majority of them have a major chip on their shoulder (and features at their disposal to easily prevent you enjoying the game). This also has a negative impact on  connectivity creating lag and frequent disconnects. Cheaters's ability to spawn in objects also effects performance as these will persist between sessions and can only be removed from the game world by restarting your client.The laughable part is that all of this could have been easily preventable by investing a little more in the games network infrastructure before launch or at least made more difficult for the hackers by licensing a third party anticheat, but to save costs and increase revenue the publishers have allowed cheaters to run rampant and taken draconian measures against those seeking to provide an alternative. If you are considering buying the game at this late stage in its life for the online portion alone please reconsider as its simply an excercise in frustration.I'd be amazed if they could turn it around at this point.

At around 1:00 this morning, when I was tucked in and asleep in my bed, Rockstar, without provocation or reason, banned my account for 30 days and reset my character. If you think this can't happen to you, that your account will be safe because you don't cheat, I hate to break it to you but you are completely naive. I had 800 hours in game and never modded or used an exploit with my online account. I grinded out my money the hard way (maybe this is why Rockstar doesn't care what I think -- because I haven't bought into their overt attempts at pushing players to purchase shark cards). Rockstar is unable to stop modders and hackers so they resort to blaming victims. In typical Rockstar fashion, they won't even respond to my support tickets with anything beyond a form email saying that banned/reset accounts are not subject to appeal.

Climbing mountains, stealing jets, pimping some car you stole, heavy police chases, stunts, skydiving and many more thing to do. Gta V isn't just story mode but it's a race game, a shooter, life simulator, sports game (lol) IT'S JUST EVERYTHING! Even though in my opinion it isn't as fun as online. Something though whenever you buy a car and if it is lost or destroyed you can't get it back that is disapointing, at online you just call your insurance and they get it back for ya. Further there is nothing bad about it's just very solidly made by Rockstar. GTA V Online So this what I've played most, in two weeks I've played 64 hours. This is just so addicting. Along the road you meet new people, you make friends, and with them you can have so much fun. In my opinion GTA V is better in multiplayer, and having an own character. So here you have everything, just everything you have at Story mode plus on top of that you have own MC clubs, own company's, you can buy more garages and apartments, you can do all the things in Story mode with your friends as yourself. It's your character, you write the story. But now the bad things. Even though it's better than Story mode it has more bad points. For example Shark cards, I mean I bought 100k for 2.5 Euro's that is still okay but 75 Euro's for 8 million Rockstar what??? Buying Shark cards up to 10 Euro's is normal but above that it is a waste of money. I've heard a lot of stupid things about unfair bans, it hasn't happened to me but it is really stupid and Rockstar should do something about it. For someone who hasn't been banned yet and really enjoys playing online it's just scary to know that you could get banned anytime for no reason. Please fix. But other than those 2 things everything is really great and I haven't even covered all the positive things, neither the bad but this are the most important things in my opinion. GTA V Online,  PASS . Conclusion GTA V is by far one of the best games I have ever played in my life. It's just so great that some games don't even have a chance to compete with it. It has some bad points some good points, but all games have good and bad points. This is an almost perfect game. Rockstar good job! Definitely recommended for everyone!",1.0

"The Curse of GreedThere is a lot to be said about a product whose development is driven primarily by monetary greed rather than customer satisfaction. I feel it is a significant shame that such a overall good product is being plagued by the hands of such people, a product that has so much potential for a very wide range of video game entertainment, a potential that has been effectively utilized over the past few years by creative modifications by the talented community that has built itself around this playground of a game. A potential that however is now being whittled down due to corporate greed.Mods have for a long time built upon the foundation of this title better than the developers of it, and out of fear of losing monetary benefit in favor of something that others do better and for free, that activity have now been more or less shut down for that very reason.When such a clear-cut action is made against the satisfaction of the consumer and in favor of the monetization of the title, it becomes difficult to avoid the thought that this game is not being developed for the purpose of making something that will make it's players satisfied, but rather to make something that will make it's players invest as much money into it as possible. When such a circumstance is made so clear, I can't imagine how anyone could overlook such a revolting goal of those in charge of what you are consuming. If the purpose of this title's development is monetary benefit and only monetary benefit, then that is going to influence every addition made in such a way that something that could be great will lose a lot of it's value to accommodate for the demand of being monetization friendly.It is revolting from a personal standpoint, but it is also unacceptable from a business standpoint. When a product gets as large and respected as Grand Theft Auto V, people might assume that they can get away with anything they do it, so an action certainly needs to be made to clearly state the opposite so that such a business practice does not continue or grow even further. People who are ruled by greed will push the limits of what they are able to get away with, and that line has not only been crossed here, but jumped past by several measures.",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto V is a great game, don't get me wrong. However, the singleplayer modding community that helps keep the GTA games alive and popular being shut down is inexcusable. Take Two Interactive, if you are reading this. Please listen to a person who has been a long time fan of the Grand Theft Auto series of games. This is a huge mistake. You are shooting yourselves in the foot by doing this. People buy older games in the series like San Andreas and GTA IV mainly due to the modding capabilities. These games are still fantastic games, but by doing this you are removing a large chunk of potential customers who want to revisit these classics with mods and customization. San Andreas and older games do not even have online multiplayer. What could you possibly have to gain by alienating one of your biggest groups of fans by shutting down something that these people who have put their talents and time into creating new content for these games WITHOUT PAY. These people are not doing this for money, they are doing this because they love your product. Taking that freedom and ability to customize your game is basically a slap in the face to an entire group of people who may have even wanted to work for you and make the next GTA game.I love Grand Theft Auto V, and I am honestly disappointed in this decision that you have made.",1.0
"This game is the definition of a Grind to win game. I spent 4 years since day 1 and even pre-ordered on Xbox 360 and have been playing since, until 3 months ago when I finally bought this game on PC when my Xbox One stopped working. I entered a lobby and behold a Modder was modding the server. Guess what? Rockstar banned my account for a month, and also reset all my data years of hard work and earning money, also buying money with real money. Now they're trying to also destroy single player modding as well, I've hardly ever modded Singleplayer, but to destroy the fun of other people is unacceptable. Rockstar only cares about profit. I will not be buying another GTA in the future. Go **** yourself Rockstar, and Take-Two. Do not spend your hard earned money or a parents hard earned currency.",1.0

(id love to help you but i cant even open your file to see why you were banned... if i do ill be fired... and for that matter if i tell you any more than this ill also be fired.)  when u call rockstar and they want to hang up on you when asking about a ban its simply cuase they will lose their job if they even try to look into it.,1.0

"I will preface this review by saying that I have had this game since it's release on the Xbox 360, which has as many if not more hours logged than my PC copy. I have had great fun with this game over the time I have played it, and I have to give kudos to Rockstar for continuing to develop new content (this recent Gunrunning update, for example, which adds an appreciable amount of free content). THAT BEING SAID:            I can no longer, in good conscience, support this game or the business practices followed by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive. The basis for my conclusion rests mostly in the way the multiplayer GTA Online service has been handled. I have no problems with the single player Story mode, besides the fact that no substantial new content was ever added to it, limiting it immensely. As an avid player of this game, it did not take long for me to have done everything worthwhile in the Story mode, leaving me with the regularly updated multiplayer (and of course the option of simply replaying the Story mode, which gets stale after the third time). Thus, the only way for me to get any real entertainment out of the game at this point is through the multiplayer.           At first, Online was actually quite good in terms of what a player had to do in order to gain levels and money for what was available at the time (the most expensive single transaction being a Titan plane at GTA$2 million). Missions and races gave an appropriate amount of money and RP for the level of difficulty they presented, and said difficulties made sense and were balanced. A player could easily afford anything they could want with an appropriate amount of playing and grinding said missions. At this point in time, the Shark Cards were acceptable, seeing as the time-to-money-ratio was not terrible and the Shark Cards gave appropriate payouts that reflected the amout of grind skipped proportionate to the values of what was available at launch.           However, it became increasingly apparent, at least to me, that decisions were being made to make earning money more and more difficult while simultaneously making the DLCs more and more expensive in terms of in-game GTA$. The largest initial step made to do this was an across-the-board nerfing of all missions' payouts and RP gain, while also concurrently  PUNISHING  efficient players by instating a system that only allowed the full payout of a mission to be given only if more than (I believe) 20 minutes were spent playing said mission. It's not as if the payouts were reduced a little bit, as many appropriately-lucrative missions had their payouts reduced to almost if not more than 50% of their original payout. This severely neutered all player's ability to fairly gain money severely. All the while, DLCs were released with new, mor expensive items such as super cars that were significantly better than existing models (no original models of super car compare to newer ones in races anymore).           I would not have had a problem with any of what I have said or about to say if one simple model were followed: the value of real money to money gained through Shark Cards should have reflected the new content and increased difficulty of earning money by decreasing the real money needed per GTA$ as time went on. However, cards such as the Great White Shark Card, which gives GTA$1.25 million and costs $50 USD remained the same, and their relative worth in the Online game only decreased. The real cost should have decreased, or the amount of GTA$ given increased (or both at the same time), however this has obviously not been done in any way, shape or form.           Then came the Finance and Felony updates, which promised new ways to earn big money . . . except for the fact that you needed more than GTA$1 million to even  BEGIN USING THE NEW CONTENT.  You had to purchase a CEO office, the cheapest of which, with no additions, costs exactly GTA$1 million, plus at least a small warehouse which all cost around GTA$100,000 or more. In addition, the maximum payout for the cargo missions is GTA$2 million, which can only be achieved with a large warehouse which cost significantly more than small OR medium warehouses. Thus, to even be able to play the full content that was released, you would need upwards of at least GTA$1.5 million. That price would have been realtively acceptable, if not for the aforementioned fact that ALL players' ability to make any appreciable amount of money got severely cut down.           The same case goes for Import/Export, which required an office and vehicle warehouse. It also further encouraged other players to grief one another (for ludicrously paltry rewards, too), which actually discouraged cooperation and interacting with other players, and made many players seek out empty lobbies, ultimately defeating the spirit of Online play in general. Not to mention the insane price tags on the special vehicles, which were all in the multi-million-dollar price ranges. Even with these new ways to make money, it would take full days of gameplay to even be able to make near GTA$2 million. Any player that plays the game fairly from scratch at this point would need hundreds of hours to be able to access all the content. The same goes for the Bikers update, and Gunrunning, which require millions of GTA$ to even become remotely profitable, which is of course made worse by the fact that almost no player is going to have the amount of free time necessary to acquire the GTA$  needed to play all of said content (especially in the case of Gunrunning, which not even Megalodon Shark Card, at $100USD to GTA$8 million, can afford you all the content therein).           All of these factors lead me to conclude that the Online game has been molded to better push the sales of Shark Cards, under the guise of ""free"" DLC. This content cannot be called ""free"" in any sense of the word if the only way to actually play it in any reasonable amount of time is to purchase hundreds of USD-worth of Shark Cards. No normal human being will be able play the amount of hours needed to actually get the money fairly though the game unless they have no other obligations (job, school, family . . . literally anything else OTHER than playing this game). People rely on people who give cheated money, or they cheat themselves simply because there is no other reasonable option (no, buying hundreds of USD-worth of Shark Cards is  NOT REASONABLE ). Also the argument for the Shark Cards being a necessity to keep the DLC free would be more valid if not for the fact that GTA V has been in the top 10 bestselling games on the entirety of Steam  SINCE IT'S PC RELEASE.  Being priced at $60 USD (not to mention themassive sales of other Rockstar titles), that should be more than enough to sustain the release of the DLC.           In addition to these factors, it also seems as if Take Two Interactive wants to demolish the entire GTA V modding community with Cease and Desist orders against benign software such as Open IV (Their claims of it affecting Online play is a bold-faced lie, as Open IV cannot do anything to the Online on it's own, and would require memory injection to have any affect whatsoever, in additon to the fact that Open IV is not even used in this way either, as there are better tools for affecting the Online game). Whatever your opinion of modifying GTA V, there is much evidence pointing to mods improving the longevity of games. It is my opinion that GTA Online has reached a point where it is no longer viable for most people to play the game fairly and is thusly inappropriate for the publisher (Take Two) to lash out at these people when they should actually pay attention to their consumer base for once and fix the Online game's business model. Of course, I doubt they would ever do this, depsite all the negative press they are continually generating for themselves, BECAUSE:  Money. ",1.0
After 400 hours of playing it’s getting boring But it’s fun for a while. You should check out GTA Online because it’s fun for the next 400 hours and this game is worth all your pennies so far. But the updates comes twice per year and That’s sad. Rockstar needs more updates to keep the game fresh. Buy it. It’s fun and Will take you on a trip to the loves los santos. Peace out guys.,1.0

"Been playing this game since it came out on PC and have 1,305.5 hrs of playtime. PLayed story mode twice, after first run through went to online and to me online is better and now mainly play online. Have over 90 friends met through the game so now have an idea of who will follow through on missions.Got rained on with money over a year ago, just quit server and avoided a ban, which was not my doing anyway...nowadays i hear they are very strict on that so if it were to happen again would just quite the server i am on again. I prefer to buy a shark card from time to time and well worth it to play for a weekend, plus plenty of money to be made from missions so why complain?Hackers are a PIA sometimes. For example, just got my car out from being wrecked and was going to mod shop, pull up to door and get exploded by a hacker who then flew away like a rocket...slight inconvenience since just had to repeat the process...honestly, dont understand why people hack...and ""hack"" may be the wrong term.That said, graphics are very good even on my GTX670, just lower resolution below 1920 and was able to increase some settings, and there are youtube videos to explain that more and what to adjust. No problem for me as not ready to upgrade my 2012 video card just yet so could not be happier.The game did get me to buy a steam conmtroller just for the driving and it was worth it as well as all controls while driving are editable and only need the controller with some modifications to the buttons am able to do everything i need.Sum it up in one word -FUN :)ETA: It would be awesome to add a full out DLC that extends original story mode, i thought the story was amazing for a game and add new missions, real missions, in online mode and would be worth the price of game...iow's why bother with a GTA6 and make it a continuation since the game is too extravagant as is and the map, graphics still hold up...imop.",1.0

"Buy Only for singleplayer.Online sucks. unlike most i dont have a whole speech about how i got banned. That didnt happen. What did is that the way they have the entire system set up is that you have to make money entirely from heists. Any attempt to actually enjoy the executives mode or biker mode are ruined by the playerbase that has collectivly decided that anybody attempting to anything but shoot each other is a bad thing and target you and anybody working with you. While i understand that the ability to interfear with those things is a part of it, being targeted by jets and people with armored vehicles over crap that costs less than the ammo they waste to do it has ultimately ruined online mode for me. Things would be different if those things were available in private or friend only modes. But with them being limited to the public mode only, you need a huge team of people and literally a fighter jet just to be able to move the smallest amounts of crap  for said modes. ultimately limiting those modes to people that have either bought so much in game cash that they dont need to, Modders (Which dont get banned for some reason, yet normal people do. Weird.) , or said jerkoffs who have made it so people like me who want to sit down and play the game without having to arrange a literal military escort not want to even touch said modes. Along with the fact that you more often than not get shot on sight make the whole ""online experince"" feel like a place you have to throw money into just to watch it burn.EDIT- Over the release of the last couple DLCS ive began to notice a trend that rockstar pushes cash cards over actually gameplay with most of the dlcs slowly turning into.Go to Factory/Office/BunkerOrder suppliescollect suppliesAvoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s because of the emphasis on blowing up each others stuff to encorage loss of incomesomehow make♥♥♥♥♥♥get there.Wait foreverdeliver said♥♥♥♥♥♥br>Avoid ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s again because of the toxic♥♥♥♥♥communitymake a tiny sum of cash that frankly isnt worth all the time put into itSo in conclusionF*ck off rockstar.

It did not provide the feeling of apprehension at the beginning and neither any form of satisfaction at the end. Secondly, it lacked variety. While playing this game i was remembering all the unique missions from san andreas, vice city and gta IV and thinking where are all those missions.2. Though the three characer switching was innovative and i did enjoy each of their storyline, but I did not feel attached to any of the characters since i was not playing with any of them for long.3.

"GTA V is not really all that fun. Buy this game on sale if you want to enjoy the story, or if you have 3 other friends to enjoy this game with. Otherwise you'll spend 1-5 minutes waiting for GTA Online to load, login to server with people level 500+ and a penchant for killing people who aren't in passive. Trying to find a lobby with people to finish a heist is next to impossible when people either leave at the sight of a lower level or less than perfect performance, and with little incentive to stick around I don't blame them. Constant begging for shark-card purchases, everything in the game is locked off by extravegant amounts of money that are only possible with (as mentioned earlier) 3 friends who are willing to work together, sheer luck, hacking, and buying shark cards. Online races are essentially just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ renditions of TrackMania user-made content with sudden inclines, and busted♥♥♥♥♥track design. Do yourself a favor and play San Andreas, or stick to the story mode in this game. If all the above isn't an issue for you then go for it.",1.0

T2 Milking the multiplayer and add DLC with overpriced items which require a ton of grind to get. This is done so players buy shark cards for an easy cash grab for the company.

"Singleplayer: 10 / 10. The best characters of all the GTA games, and by far (I've played them all since GTA 3).Multiplayer: 7 / 10, I guess. Heists, the high-end money-earning activity, are not very well thought-out and get boring soon. Other activities are fun, but don't provide income or incur losses. And you'll need A LOT of money to buy nice things in this game.#1 downside: CHEATERS. Lots and lots of them, and they do very annoying bad things to you.#2 downside: the system requirements. My AMD HD 6950 runs it well @ 1920x1080, but I had to turn the graphics settings down enough that my pictures doesn't look as good as the screenshots (to a large extent because of no AA, but not only that).",1.0

"Overall this is a good game that I will continue to play. That being said I can't give this a positive review solely because of the amount of hacking I encounter whilst playing online. On a weekly basis I see people with godmode on and aim hack that just ruins the whole online experience, to the point where I barely play in public lobbies. If you make a private session to play in with your friends this game is a blast. Otherwise, its like rockstar has not put any effort at all into getting rid of cheaters, and a lot of the players that actually do get banned complain that they did not cheat. Which, honestly, I believe with the way rockstar has treated online. Prepare to get spawn killed, or enjoy playing in passive mode instead. Yet many updates with expensive new cars and bikes etc come out prodding us to buy shark cards, nice to see they have their priorities straight.",1.0

"This game appears to be getting raked through the mud due to the abhorrent pricing on Shark Cards. Game's fun and all, but that just won't slide. Best recommendation is to fight with your wallet.

"GTA5 a beautiful world created, amazing attention to detail and Single player is a lot of fun and well worth the money for that alone, Online is where it becomes a mess unsurprisingly and not just because of the lack of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ filter, its also due to Rockstars inability to provide decent anti-cheat, add to that their absolutely amateur way of dealing with any issues and it makes online really not worth it.Point in case i joined a random lobby as the game forces you to, i join and suddenly my cash amount starts going silly, its a hacked lobby and the numpty is giving everyone that joins millions, i leave the room, send an email to rockstar informing them of what happened and asking them to put me back to where i was (I had $1.9m of my own money) i don't hear anything back, stop playing a couple of days later and take a break, come back a month or so later to find that rockstars way of dealing with the problem was to reset all my funds to $0 well done rockstar you cash grabbing ♥♥♥♥ing idiots.They also promised lots of single player DLC and add ons but when the money started puring in from online they put all their resources to the cash cow and milked for as much as they could, singleplayer stayed vanilla and nothing was ever added, FiveM was a great mod that came out which gave the option to create a server more in-line with what GTA5 should have been anyway, They banned/blocked it for fear of it taking away their huge revenue stream of shark cards.The community went mental and actively started avoiding the game, player numbers dwindled and the fat cats eventually realised they can't be a greedy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ every moment of the day and relented.Lots of things wrong with the business model Rockstar/take two chose to run on this game from a gamer point of view, but from a business/financial point ov view its been a stellar product which shouldnt surprise because they are a business and thats it.I have played every GTA since the first one and enjoyed them all, mainly because they were great single player stories ad huge detailed open worlds to explore, GTA5 is no different and is the most beautiful and well detailed of them all, what ruins this masterpiece is the online side of it, and the fact it was such a cash cow they didn't bother with what they promised for singleplayer.Singleplayer 10/10Multiplayer cash grab/fail  2/10FiveM Mod online 8/10TL:DR i recommend this game for singleplayer only and the only online i would promote would be FiveM reborn, the online that comes with the game is deeply flawed and a massive grindfest, once you have grinded for everything, they then add another couple of skinned cars/vehicles/heli/whatever always now for at least $1m each and is meant to get you grinding again or wasting real money on shark cards.",1.0
"Rockstar is essentially the Anti-Fun Police being run by Chief Take-Two Ineractive regarding GTA Online.Why you may ask? Well, let me demonstrate.They release 'free' DLC. 'Free' but only if you grind harder than a stripper trying to get a raise or blow more money than the guy paying for that grinding. Rockstar doesn't want you to enjoy their game, they want you to thrive on it and basically ♥♥♥♥♥ slap you if you don't give them their money even though you already paid a -- 60 DOLLAR PRICE POINT FOR A SEVERAL YEAR OLD GAME!Updates come frequently, sure. But if you don't have 3, 4, 5 million dollars, plus whatever side expenses that don't come with those addons you won't get to play it and you certainly won't make more money doing it. As example, if you want to play the Import/Export expansion, you have to first buy a CEO Tower, then you have to follow up and buy a warehouse for those cars. Something that can cost way more money than you were willing to get in for. On top of this, missions don't pay as much as they should in order for you to maintain at least a level of wealth in this game. Small basic missions pay as much as $10,000 dollars, no where near enough to even pay for a decent car upgrade. When the difficulties start getting harder it still doesn't pay as much as it should. Harder missions only pay out, at best, $25,000, somewhere still no where near what should be given out. If payments were more fair then it'd be fine. Such as $75,000-$100,000 would be much more fair but Rockstar doesn't want that as you'll buy Shark Cards out of frustration. Heists are another level of a joke though. Heists, once again, pay no where near what they should. Making only several hundred grand for a 3-5 level setup followed by the heist itself. The heists 'split' payment is dumb amongst itself. Only, at most, $1,000,000 to a player if all other players take a small 5% hit. Not to mention on top of this, the difficulty curve of these are extremely unrealistic in terms of gameplay. Bots have aimbot-like aim, capable of hitting you in the head with pin point accuracy with a submachine gun that even a high level player couldn't do even if they tried. In the end, this game is a joke multiplayer wise. The development team clearly cares very little for it now as all they do is take away fun whenever there is some to be had by nerfing or removing things to get clear of problems. The people in charge are nothing but greedy old men that clearly have no understanding of the modern game industry and need to be fired and/or removed from their position of power. You want fun? Go play a game that doesn't force you to look to spending more money than it's already worth.",1.0

Play as any character like the Republican Space Ranger and you can enable cheats, making you feel like a superhero. You'll be able to make some really creative movies with all the options they've given you, an improvement over GTA 4. They've also added a custom radio station as well. This is truly the ultimate version of GTA 5 and I highly recommend it.Update:It appears that the PS4 and Xbox One will be getting a version of the Rockstar Editor. If you already own the game on those systems, then it may not be worth buying the game again for PC. For those that played the game on PS3 and Xbox 360, this is worth buying again.",1.0

"I own this game on 4 consoles (PC, PS4, PS3, Xbox One) and have never used a mod in my life. The actual concept of banning Open VI and other mods is baffling. The success of the franchise is built on the freedom it affords and the great content it brings. This is why Rockstar has created the most loyal gamers in the world today and has done so for close to 20 years. Take Two's incredibly stupid and misguided decisions based on stakeholders who in all likelihood have no idea about how to make a game great has turned me off for life.. I have always purchased shark cards as a testament to how good the game continues to be but will avoid it outright from now on. Horrible and irrational decision.Look at Watch Dogs 2, Battlefield 1, Titanfall 2, COD, Dishonored 2 for how gamers feel when there is a cash grab scenario involved.

"This game has a FOV (field of view) of around 85° (in first person of course) and this would be acceptable if you were to play the game on a TV at a distance, however this is not high enough for most people who play at monitor and are much closer to it. While Rockstar has yet to offer a solution modders have already brought out mods that fix this problem, which would be great! The problem is, the game is banning people for using these mods even in single player. Rockstar either needs to fix their anti-cheat to allow players to use FOV mods or they need to update their own FOV slider that goes above 85° to around 100-110°. As well as, they must remove the bans they have on people who modded their game for a higher field of view. If you want to get the game believe me it is a fantastic game, just be warned any type of modification for at least the moment will risk you getting banned (this does include single player as well).",1.0

"Moving on from the console versions of GTA V, even after months of delaying and waiting, this game proves to still amaze all gamers. Obviously, the graphics is the biggest upgrade, but the delation for the release of the game turned out well for its great optimization to the PC port. It's amazing how relatable gameplay is with consoles just by using a controller. Feels like there's no difference except (better) performance, graphics, and details in the game (like its music). I already owned a 360, PS4, and Xbox One version of GTA V, but it was well worth $60 to buy the PC version. You get what you paid for, and even more. This PC port is what every game developer should aim for. How optimized it is at launch compared to other games that releases a dead-bugged game that makes it almost impossible to play.

THE FOLLOWING IS A PERSONAL PREFERENCE READ THE FOLLOWING WITH A OPEN MINE OR F*CK OFF i have played all versions of the game and the changes between xbox 360/PS3 graphics and Xbox one/PS4 are massive to be honest it is a waste of money if you own a console copy. the graphical changes between current gen console GTA and PC is next to nothing on top of that they have promised many additions on all platforms but it is still not here they promise additions many additions and hold back as proof of this look at the heist DLC it was delayed for a bit over 1 year even the PC version has taken blows like this it was meant to be released in late 2014 here we are in 2015 and it was still getting delayed unless rockstar lifts their game i think this game is in some ways the worst GTA to be released if i had to rate it i must say as much as i am level headed between PC and console i'd say console is like a 8.5/10 and PC in its current state is like 3.5/10 MY OPINION MAY CHANGE WITH ROCKSTARS PROGRESS BUT I AM UNSURE IF THIS IS GOING TO CHANGE MY OPINIONTHE F*CKING HACKERS CHANGED MY MINDnew score is actualy 1.5/10,0.0

Great gameplay, gunplay and Lots of variety of activities that will keep you coming back endlessly.GTA 5 -10/10GTA online - never thought R* would create such a fun world to spend endless hours.. hundreds of activities to do. yes the in game stuff is overpriced to sell shark cards, but its like an mmo and so much fun , so i don't mind the grind. Plus they release lots of free content which adds more playability. No wonder around 70k people are playing the game after 3 yrs of release. Two major complaints are hackers and potato servers :( still i think i can manage to have fun inspite of those..GTA Online - 8.5/10",1.0

"You need not read reviews about the game to know that this game is ♥♥♥♥ing great.  It has all you have come to expect from a GTA game and the superior frames per second that people often argue about. This game is a piece of art. It evokes emotion, it is aesthetically pleasing and is an absolute pleasure to play. The world is alive, filled with people who are doing their own thing, people who will react to you, people who you react to, people who you may kill, people who you may rob, people who you may save. I look forward to the next few content updates and patches that will add more things to this vibrant world.Most of all, it lets you do almost anything you want, even if you just want to be a three-bit gangster.I may not agree with how Rockstar is running things with the mods, modders and GTA Online but it doesn't stop me from appreciating the game and enjoying it. Its like eating at a restaurant, you don't have to like the staff but the food is delicious.",1.0
"Pretty good game. Some of the things I enjoyed right away throughout my play through is that this game is eye candy. Very nice to look at. Also a bit of fun to explore. Mini games such as towing cars, yoga, tennis, etc are nice feaures but also a bit boring. Past GTAs had vigilante missions, owning property, gang wars, which is disappointing because these were removed from GTA 5. Other than that, gameplay is very solid, and a step forward from previous GTAs. Overall, a very well optimized and good looking game with solid gameplay and exploration. However, its greatest strength is also its greatest weakness, for the game will eventually make its vast open world a boring sandbox. But for me, this game will make me last until Fallout 4 comes out.",1.0

"Great Game, horrible company. I've been banned twice now, the first time for TV remotes in my apartment that were duplicating themselves, and the second time for apparently jumping out of an airplane (This is all me guessing the most plausible cause, since you are given no reason).And as per usual, Rockstar Support refuses to be cooperative, even to the point of completely closing down their phone line to avoid having to speak to any frustrated player. Submitting a support ticket, even with evidence of your innocence, results in the same bot response and an immediate closing of the ticket. You should essentially expect to be banned at some point if you buy this game.UPDATE: After my 30 day ban ended, I decided I would play the game once more just to enjoy it before my inevitable permanent ban. And I was entirely correct, because after the entirety of one evening, I wake up to be perma-banned.Based on when I got the violation notice e-mail, It banned me when I was logging off - when I still had a three star wanted level. Oddly enough, my friend who did the exact same thing (but has no bans on his record) can still play the game. Amusing to say the least.",1.0

"By now everyone should know what to expect from this game, but i will review it anyways1. Multiplayer: I think most people would want to play this game because of its multiplayer, in general it can be fun, but the matchmaking when looking for any gamemode wont consider skill or level, the problem is that coop can be bad because you get put with some guy who doesnt understand the game or is trolling and wont get much money and XP from that mission/game. Recommended to play with friends2: Singleplayer : Very good story, not really close to real but still fun. Has NSFW content but you should know that by now already3:Performance: I have a 970 and i can max this game out and still have 60 fps pretty easily, graphics arent really that impresive  but the game isnt about them anyways. Loading is very slow mostly over a minute to get to the gameTL:DR: Multiplayer is fun with friends, but alone can be annoying, singleplayer is very good but not realistic. It performs well in my  gtx970 but the loading screen is slow. General rating 7.5/10",1.0

"I first want to say I love Grand Theft Auto V as a game.. In single player, it's such a great single player but from the minute that GTA:Online came out you knew it was going to get left behind as Take 2 couldn't really make more money out of it without DLC.Single player modding tools like OpenIV helped to give single player a breath of fresh air.. Most of the new stuff they added in GTA Online at this point you can't even get in Single Player, they claimed that they've taken this down to stop modding in online, though OpenIV was only ever used for Single Player Mods.As a result of Take 2's behaviour, I implore you to not buy shark cards, and until a time that they change their behaviour to boycott their products",1.0

"The story is fantastic and it really thrives on pulling you into the characters and the emotions they display.  You can really relate to the characters and say to yourself ""hey I have a reletive that's just like Traver.""  The graphics are wonderful and really have you take a moment to stop and take in the scenery.  If you've never played GTA V before then you're in for a treat.However, and this is the problem with returning players, if you already have played GTA Online on console and you want to transfer your character to PC then you're out of luck.  Rockstar Games has disabled character transfer.  So if you want to continue on with your GTA Online profile then you're stuck on either last gen consoles or current gen consoles.  Extremely bad news if you're stuck on last gen as you cannot continue on with all the cool and fun additions they released since they released hastes.So if you haven't played GTA Online at all (which would be doubtful unless you've never played GTA V) and you're wanting to play, then definately get this game on PC.  If you already have played this for console and already have a GTA Online character then don't buy.  I, for one, am most likely gonna get a refund on this game.",1.0
"Congratulations community! As of today, OpenIV has been reinstated and brought back. As such, I feel like the developers should be commended for it. Good job rockstar.",1.0
"Don't get me wrong, the game is good, not great but good nonetheless, Rockstar and Take Two deciding to be a bunch of money ♥♥♥♥♥s who care only about the multiplayer doesn't help.First of all, the singleplayer doesn't a lot of content, why can't we have the multiplayer content in the singleplayer part of the game?Why can't we have heists in singleplayer? Or at least bots for the heists in multiplayer and a offline mode.Second, the game has microtransactions on a game that cost 69.99$ which is stealing.Unfortunately, I was dumb enough to pre-purchased it, not having played it on consoles because I'm a PC guy, I want to give the game a try and I was sure that It would be awesome.Well, I was correct but and I also was wrong.I thought that the singleplayer would be fun enough to not get boring quickly, I was wrong about that.The map isn't that big but it's a great and detailed map, so there's nothing wrong about this but it could be even more detailed since the map isn't so big which means, being able to get inside of almost every houses and buildings in the game.There is barely any gang action in this game, unlike the previous Grand Theft Auto games which is kind of sad in my opinion.There are more vehicles in this game than the previous Grand Theft Auto games which is a plus.There are also more weapons in this one than the previous games and they are also way better to use.At least, the DLCs are free especially since they don't add much and it's only multiplayer content.I'm giving this game a 5/10 and I'm giving Rockstar 4/10.I want to give this game a positive review but I can't.Singleplayer is the most important part of a video game, if the game doesn't have a singleplayer mode (bots, campaign, survival, etc etc), I don't even want to hear about it even if the game itself is good.If the game is principally multiplayer than singleplayer, that ain't a good thing either.Video games were single-player when they first appeared then they add the multiplayer but most of them had bots or some a great campaign to play, if the singleplayer content sucked then the multiplayer was generally worse.So can I know what's wrong with this generation?Overpriced game, let's be honest about it, every games that exist on this World should be maximum 39.99$.Most of nowadays games are 110$ while it should be 9.99$ - 29.99$ (depending on the game, I'm looking at you Activision, Infinity Ward, Treyarch, Ubisoft, EA, 2K and almost every nowadays developers/publishers).Microtransactions on a overpriced game.More of a multiplayer game than a single-player game.Lot of content that is locked in the online and not available for the single-player part of the game, simply because R* want us to buy their crappy in-game money (because they want your money for doing absolutely nothing).The cop's dispatch is unrealistic, the cops are unrealistic in general.Silencers doesn't works, nothing works the way it should.The driving is horrible.And I could go on all day.5/10 (mostly negative, the game could have been so much better, hopefully they don't make the same error with Grand Theft Auto 6 which will hopefully happen to be at Vice City).Also, the online community is cancerous.They know that modders could do so much more, that's why they hate mods, they are scared, they are a bunch of incompetents that are doing barely anything to the solo and heck, even the online.Please, never buy shark cards from them, ever, it's cancer and  like every diseases, we have to get rid of it.Your best bet is to buy the game while it's cheap (less than 15$ - if that ever happens) and to mod it so you can have the multiplayer content available for the singleplayer part of the game.It's not a bad game, but the developer is literally♥♥♥♥♥♥ that's it, I don't understand why R* is so praised.They hate mods because they know people can do better than them, tha's it that's all.Seriously, some times, this game feels like an early access game that is not completed.And unfortunately, Rockstar will never learn.Note from 2017/06/17: Don't buy this crap, don't encourage R* nor Takes Two, as far as I know, 2K and R* are owned by Takes Two, do you know how crap, incompetent and greedy is 2K? Anyway, my important point is that Takes Two has asked made a claim against OpenIV.You know how R* and most devleopers hate mods? You know why? Because they're incompetent, that's a fact, they know that people can do better than them, they know that they can add more and better content and fixes most of their crap.They don't want that you know, they want to be the very best even though most of nowadays devleopers and publishers are crap at everything they do, at least, when it comes to video games and programming, that's a fact.Seriously, do NOT encourage them, stop buying their products, don't even pirate them, it's not worth it, by pirating their games, you'll be encouraging them in some kind of manner (pirating = more popularity, more popularity = more buy), simply just ignore them until they decide to wake up and maybe learn how things works.Which probably won't ever happen, just don't buy their games, not if you are a true/an hardcore gamer who loves the PC gaming with all of its possibilities such as mods, 2K, R*, Take0 Two and most of the other developers and publishers simply do not care. I can't believe that I have wasted 50$ on this crap.Edit 2017-06-26: Take Two reverse the ban of the mod OpenIV but since we have seen their true color, you still should not encourage them.IMPORTANT: Like many games nowadays, this game has memory leaks, because we know how developers are such worthless incompetents these days and how much they don't care about the consumers as long as they have money.This game has memory leaks and Rockstar doesn't give a crap about it.You can fix it, but I have heard that some got banned for fixing the memory leaks (online gameplay).You see how much incompetent and brainless Rockstar is... Just don't buy their games anymore, it is simply not worth it, except if you want to affect your computer in the long term.That is up to you.Seriously, when will they finally learn how to use their brain instead of being worthless incompetents only good at screwing over everything? That i wonder.I won't be buying any games from Take Two nor from Rockstar be it Grand Theft Auto VI, Red Dead Redemption 2, be it whatever, i won't buy it unless it is sold for about 3$. Not like they even deserve that much anyway.Simple tip: Do NOT pay for shark cards, mod the single-player game and make all the online only content/vehicles available for single-player and laugh at Rockstar and Take Two immaturity, incompetence, greediness and over-exaggerated stupidity.",1.0

"I was waiting for Rockstar to release their statement about the openIV debacle that take two opened but I am thuroughly unimpressed.OpenIV in no way affects the multiplayer section of GTAV, some hacks may use it and then go into online but openIV, a program once supported by rockstar, was given a cease and desist. This is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ way to do buisness. The single player of GTA should be both a story and a sandbox, a place to have fun. The mutiplayer should have been a mega snadbox but they turned it into a microtrasaction laden hell hole so singleplayer was the only playbox for many players.I was very willing to overlook the online problems too, It was so disheartening I stopped playing it entirely but I could understand they wanted to milk their whales of their money and screw over everyone else. I was willing to do so because single player was still our playground. Rockstar even supported single player mods and advertised them a little when an interesting one showed up... That is until a few days ago.One week ago the CEO of take two stated they are under monetising their games... a game which made multiple millions last year alone, a game that is the 4th best sold game of all time... is under monetised. Then a C&D gets given to the biggest singleplayer mod. I can only imagine they want people to move back to online so they can milk some more whales but the whales never left online, only those of us left uninterested by your buisness practices did, only those of us who wanted to have fun with our game left.Bear in mind this is IGNORING all the shady buisness practices GTAV has used before. This is ignoring many things to give them the benefit of the doubt and understanding they want to make more money... But this is going too far. I have never personally used mods on GTAV, but I do come fromt he days of the original games. The approach to mods that make the sandbox a playground is a tried and tested thing, just remember that in the games themselves were key combinations to spawn anything, give weapons... basically what openIV allowed on this version.Rockstar. You had ONE chance to make a statement that condemned the actions of take two, that it went against the core philosophy of GTA, but instead you want to let it ride to see where things go. We as players are not going to let it stand and I personally will not play GTA again until this is fixes. This includes any new GTA's you have planned and any old versions I still have on disc.",1.0

"Dont get me wrong, its an amazing game both single player and online, but its also one of the most frustrating games i know. The online being the best part of the game is massively infested with modders and cheaters alike, who have no limit to what they can do to you in a session. Wether its just simply griefing, forcing you to do things or be places you dont wanna be.... or more recently being able to flag you for the automated ban system. I had the unfortunate luck to run into one such modder and now thanks to Rockstars zero tolerance policy when it comes to bans, all my 250+ hours of progress has been wiped with no chance to appeal.If you do buy this game, research what you are getting into because this game takes a lot of time and while the game is good, its community is one of the most toxic, degrading organisms i have ever had the pleasure to deal with.Cant wait to read the comments on this review saying im a cheater :D",1.0

"I got into the GTA series with GTA 3, a very long time ago.  It was fun, then VC came out, they improved on it, slightly. It was also fun.  Then Rockstar decided to up the duty on the series and released SA.  Now that was major fun.  You could fly, you could swim, you could dive, you could do so much.  And it was a story mode based game, but in a sandbox form.  You could go anyplace, do anything.  It really changed the way games are made.  In my opinion.Rockstar then screwed up with GTA IV, forcing everyone into a world where the game could only be played online.  No way to play it offline.  They improved the graphic's, but screwed up the game play with such things as plane and heli controls. In that, Rockstar has once again failed.  Forcing everyone into the Social Club to be able to play a game they just spent 60 bucks on.  The Social Club is the biggest waste that I have seen out of the folks at Rockstar.   But really no other real complaints to be said.  HOWEVER.  Rockstar truly stepped up with the sandbox form of game world, while keeping the story mode like they did in SA.  The world is massive, it's a thrill, the graphic's are beyond belief. The game AI seems to have been changed, tweeked and improved. Rockstar added in cats, deer, dogs, even rats running around in Los Santos.  And I still keep finding things in the game world that I never thought possible in a game like this.GTA V is one spectacular achievement in game world physic's, game play and with the sandbox enviroment. Rockstar truly has redefined the bar, yet again.  Since GTA V unlocked for PC on Steam, I have put in 18 hrs, split between story mode and in the online world.  And this is an achievement beyond anything I could have imagined.  It behaves much like SA, and that has really drawn me in.  But this isn't SA, this is 1,000 times better.  I will miss my old SA, But GTA V has drawn me in.  I'm hooked.",1.0

"This is exciting: So far, the PC version of GTA 5 is almost everything I could possibly want from a port – outside of timely, of course. After a nearly 60GB download and resetting my Rockstar Social Club password (because who remembers that?) my first few hours of driving, running, and gunning my way through Rockstar’s masterpiece of a virtual city looked, performed, and controlled better than it does on any other platform.First, a warning: Rockstar’s QA somehow managed to miss a bug that potentially renders GTA 5 unplayable if your Windows user name contains any “special characters,” meaning anything other than letters and numbers. If your account is, for example, “Dave’s PC” or “Steve & Jane,” you might not be able to play until it’s patched, unless you create an alternate user account. To Rockstar’s credit, there’s currently a warning on the Steam store page, and Rockstar is offering refunds if you’re not willing to wait for the fix - so at least they’re handling this the right way.Assuming your user name is compliant, then, everything else is rosy. Graphics options are plentiful and powerful, with everything from standard quality and view-distance adjustments to a field-of-view slider (though it’s more limited than discriminating FOV players might want - I expect modders will remedy that shortly). It’ll support 4K resolutions and multi-monitor layouts. Controls are customizable, and you can play your own music library on the in-game radio. It’s hard to complain much about that.And those options are actually extremely useful, because optimization looks to be on point. My GeForce GTX 660Ti (a ₹25000 card) is able to run with most settings maxed out at 1600*900 without dipping below 50 frames per second. Once I tune it precisely, I’ll let you know where I’ve landed with my settings to maintain a smooth 60 – I’m not someone who demands more than 30 frames to find a game enjoyable, but I sure do appreciate the smoothness you get from double that performance. The PC version is the only way you can play GTA like this, and it’d be really tough to go back.For the most part, the menus are well done and feel good to use with the mouse. That’s best exemplified with the web browser, which feels like you’d expect navigating a web page with a mouse to feel. The one place this breaks down a little is in the score menus; it’s still a little tougher to navigate an Ammunation’s wares with a D-pad or arrow keys, but it’s still totally workable.Shooting control is good enough that it risks making things too easy. I don’t pretend to be a brilliant marksman, but if you’re a bad guy (or a cop) in Los Santos, your odds of even making it out of your car to start shooting drop considerably when the hand that guides the gun is using a mouse. Without the scourge of auto-aim dragging the targeting reticule down toward center mass, I found myself picking off most enemies with a single shot to the head, especially when playing in first-person mode.Nice PC-specific control touches, like not having to hammer a button to keep up running speed (just hold down Shift) and being able to hit a single button (Caps Lock by default) to activate a special ability make everything feel like a native PC game. You don’t get the annoying horizontal drift when running in first-person like you do in the PS4 and Xbox One versions, either.One of my favorite things about the control setup, though, is that like GTA 4 and a select few other games before it, GTA 5 lets you seamlessly swap between the mouse and keyboard and a gamepad on the fly. No need to go into a menu and swap - just push a button on one or the other, and all on-screen prompts change to reflect what you’re using. It’s a fantastic thing for a game like this, where running and gunning is more precise with a mouse and keyboard but driving or especially flying benefits greatly from the analog input of a thumbstick.In fact, you don’t even have to choose one or the other! In our first Review in Progress video, you can see a second player and I share control of a vehicle; him driving with the gamepad and me shooting with the mouse. Sure, it’s a little tough to drive when someone else is controlling what you can see, but it’s a crazy kind of co-op control that you should try out if you like to shoot more than drive, and have a friend who prefers to be behind the wheel.I’ve yet to delve into the Rockstar Editor movie maker or GTA Online – that’s on my agenda for the next couple of days. The one thing I’ve noticed that’s a tad annoying about the movie maker so far is that as I progress through the story missions, I’m unlocking characters – like Michael’s family – for use in my movies. That seems like the sort of meaningless progression system that just gets in the way of doing what I want to do when I want to do it for the sake of giving me an extra reward. Not a big deal, obviously.The other FYI is that I haven't had any luck getting cloud saves to work, which means all the progress I made at home last night remains... at home.The VerdictGrand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game, and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open-world games aspire, and it’s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both in single-player and multiplayer, plus great creative tools, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.10/10",1.0
"Hey guys, I don't usually write reviews, but Grand Theft Auto V is a game that is absolutely worth it. A game that breaked most impressive records of Guiness Book:Best-selling action-adventure video game in 24 hours (12 milion copies)Best-selling video game in 24 hours (564 milion$)Fastest entertainment property to gross $1 billionFastest video game to gross $1 billionHighest-grossing video game in 24 hoursHighest revenue generated by an entertainment product in 24 hours (including Hollywood movies)Most viewed trailer for an action-adventure video gameMost viewed trailer of an action-adventure video-game (800+ milion views)Graphics1. Graphics texture optimization is absolutely incredible. The game runs smooth on any kind of GPU's and CPU's as long as you can meet the minimum system requirements. By the way, these requirements are actually not that high for a game that has such breathtaking graphic details.2. Graphic details are the best I have seen, especially in an open-world game. If I was to tell you all about this topic, I would probably need to make a coffee to keep me awake for many hours, because boy there are lots to talk about. I'm just gonna write some of the features that stood up for me. a) Day/Night cycle recreation. Sure this is not something new in its essence, it has been done before and not just in GTA, but the way we see it here it's what's amazing. The way the light shifts from one period of the day to another it's off the charts. You don't even realize when the afternoon becomes evening. The only way you can tell, it's that a beautiful sunset light is falling down upon you.b) Rain. Again, not a new feature, actually is quite an old one BUT the way it's been reproduced in GTAV ... You can literally see every rain drop falling on the ground and splashing itself at impact. Apart from the obvious, what makes rain so special in GTAV ? Well, THE SOUND . This is something that not many people talk about, yet is one of the breathtaking features of the game.The way Rockstar Games produced the sound in game its mind blowing and it has a great effect on the rain (besides everything else).c) Night time, baby! Sure we had night in GTA IV and even before that, so why do I mention this ? Well, because the city never looked better under the moonlight shadows. I am not talking just about the graphics aspect. What I'm saying is that the night in GTAV gives you the impression of actual liveliness; the whole city comes to life. It's just like in the real big cities when people go out at night to party or to do whatever.3. Cars are the best looking and are way ahead those we've seen in previous GTA's. I'm not talking about a direct comparison, because of the obvious reason (2015-2010) but what I'm trying to say is that I personally wasn't that impressed at the time by the cars/helis/planes in GTA4 as I am now in GTAV.Gameplay and FeaturesOh yea, the gameplay options and features are the best weapon for GTAV to fight against any competitor now and in the years to come.1. Car Control I feel like thanking Rockstar games for actually doing a great job in this matter. Car control was preety much garbage in GTA IV and for this reason alone I had no big expectations for this new series. Well, I was wrong. The car control is so well polished that it gave me the impression of playing NFS MW back in the day. Besides the control, there is the sound of the car's engine which is perfectly accurate.2. Randomness. Now what in God's name I'm talking about?! Well, have you been driving down the coast or in the mountains or even in the city borders and happen to meed somebody out of the blue crying for your help ? A woman's that was about to get♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ a kid who's bike was stolen, hitchhiker asking you to take her/him home, etc usually for a reward. If you think about that it dosnt sound like a big deal, but baby, this stuff gives GTAV a whole new dimension of impersonating reality in a video game.3. Los Santos Customs. Again, not something new but let me tell you why this one is so damn special. Have you tried modifying the car's suspension? Of course you did, what am I saying! But have you actually paid attention of it's realism AFTER the change was made? Well, for those who haven't and for the one's who dont own the game yet, let me tell you that this feature is game-making. My favorite car in GTAV is the Grotti Carbonizzare also known as the Ferarri F12. Now think, how am I gonna drive that beast on the city's roads? Especially in areas like Groove, Hilwood, Rockford. These are just some of the areas that have bumpy roads, so you cant really drive a Ferarri in these parts of the town. Well, you can. Modifying the suspension to a higher state doesn't just make for visual effects, but actually changes the way the car handles the bumpy roads, turns, hard turns. BTW, if you move your mouse besides the car while taking a turn, you can actually see the suspension come into play even on lowest graphic settings. For me, this is one of the best things I've seen in this game. 4. Activities. Driving, mission making, robberies, flying, hunting, diving, piloting aircrafts, submarines, boats, golf, tennis, cards, smoke weed, racing, playing the stock market. You will never get bored in this game, not even in Single Player mode. There are so many more things to talk about, but the review would be monstruosly long, so In a few words: buy the game, it will be the best investment you have done in a PC game. For those who thaught the review was too long and skipped to the bottom, I can tell you in short, that this game excels in every aspect:: Weapons look so realistic in First Person mode, cars have a mind blowing realistic control, weather has never been better reproduced, etc. GL&HF",1.0

"What are Rockstar spending all the GTA online money on? Who knows at this point, cause it sure as heck isn't this game.Alright, I'll start with the good, the singleplayer is great and really fun, and you will get around 40 hours out of it (that's around what I got anyway). It's interesting, fun side missions, story is good, a fun time. But once its done there's not much left to do, which leaves alot to be desired. It really leaves you wanting more. Which sucks because there never will be more, yes you heard right. There will never be single player dlc for GTA V. Sucks right? It defiantely does. Now the bad, multiplayer is in all honesty a scam. If you want to buy pretty much anything you have to spend around 6-8 hours playing multiplayer a day or buy shark cards with real money(the scam). Everything is so overly priced and inassecible that you have to pick on of those two paths. Some of the modes are fun don't get me wrong, the races being the high point. Yet the experience as a whole is wieghed down by all these things that you could have but know you'll have to sink alot of you time or money into in order to get. All these expansions to multiplayer are nice, yet there not that huge. They would also be even better if they were more modestly priced. The whole thing just looks and feels like a scam to me, bought 50 dollars worth of shark cards? Congrats on your one new car you can buy. There's also the threat of hackers, I have never seen one myself but it seems alot of people get falsely banned just for being in the same lobby as a hacker which isn't cool. The multiplayer just dosen't lack any depth and will feel cool at first but will quickly wear off in a couple hours after you realize what a poor shell it is.Add to that the whole mods turmoil that happened(I could go into the details but this review would be a book if I did, you can easily find lots of info about it on the web though) and the game just feels like it didn't age well at all, and it leaves a very sour taste in your mouth. Oh and its still full price for some reason. With all of that I simply cannot recommend the game. Wait until it goes on sale for half off or so or if the price ever goes down, as the singleplayer is the only saving grace but is not worth the pricetag for a full price new game. The game did just not age well and did not have good developer choices and that is its downfall.",1.0

"     Due to the recent actions, ceasing single player mods, I am giving this review a No. This is a blatent move by Take-Two to just earn more money, not caring for the respect by players. If this does continue with KSP, they probably will see tons of sales decreasing.This review will mostly be on DLC/Content     I have been playing since the start of GTAIV, and that game never brought in overpriced DLC, which was at like 8 dollars each for the amount of story content as 1/4 of GTAIV's.      Then came Red Dead, which brought in no micro-transactions, and one great DLC. But their also was the pointless purchasable DLC like playing poker ($9.99) in multiplayer and a horse dlc ($.79).      Lastly came GTA V, where desired content by the players was delayed (heists), money was added to online, lied to about story DLC, only updated story content once or twice for early online content, and we are STILL MISSING OUR STOCK MARKET IN ONLINE SINCE RELEASE (ok that doesn't really matter). Later along GTA V release came the overpriced (ingame money) DLC, and CEO/President/VP DLC which were supposed to be a way to collect money together, but barely give any reward as it is. ",1.0

"While single player is masterfully tailored for an immersive and entertaining experience, albeit somewhat brief, I find myself unable to give the game a thumbs up. Unfortunately cons outweigh pros, generally speaking.Loading times in GTA Online are outrageous. I find myself spending far more time staring at loading screens than actually playing the game. Sadly, this isn't an overstatement.You will actually spend more time twiddling your thumbs in lobbies and in front of loading screens waiting for sessions to find players and maps to load (?).You'll also be frequently confronted by cheaters. I have witnessed players:- using godmode- spawning all weapons- giving me all weapons- shooting money at me- spawning mountain lions on top of me- spawning tanks everywhere- spawning police with rocket launchers- monkeys and pigs driving cars- UFO's rammed into the road- A mannequin prop positioned on top of my head- etc, etc, (simply allow your imagination to go rampant)Don't even get me started on heists...You'll find trolls. People bailing mid game, commiting suicide, blowing up objectives, etc. This simply leads to frustration and, needless to say, a never ending chain of lobby - load screens which will inevitably lead you to give this game the finger, at least as far as online goes.If you don't hate yourself, just stick to story mode and try to appreciate the steps tecnology has taken within the gaming world.You might think a downvote isn't warranted in this case. Well, frankly I don't care what you think. With the money the have they COULD and HAD to have done better.",0.0
"Do I recommend this as a single player game where there is no player to player interaction? Yes - Why?	- Excellent Campaign (Personal Opinion)- Emmersive world with a few nifty features (Mainly Singleplayer)- Some interesting references / 'Easter Eggs'- Diverse Characters (The Ghetto Man, The Hipster Psychopath, The Walking Midlife Crisis)- Good 50+ Hours spent on singleplayer (Provided you don't rush, and take time to appreciate)Do I recommend this game as a multiplayer game? No. - Why?	- Multiplayer is but a shadow of singleplayer (Missing alot of those 'Nifty Features' previously mentioned)- Modding problem (Money dished out to people, rendering alot of money-making features useless / Godmode, Superjump, Teleportation, Weapon Removal, essentially they are able to manipulate other players in various different ways, thus runing gameplay completely)- Devs focus too much on adversary modes (Personal opinion)- Support is rather poor (Although not in the game, with the modder problem support is very widely used, but very rarely helpful)- Awful community Conslusion	This game at a singleplayer standpoint is very good as previously mentioned, however from a multiplayer perspective it is nothing short of dreadful. By the way I am aware I have sunk alot of hours into this game, but can we really say £40 for a game where one aspect works fine, and the other is runied by either bad development choices, poor community or modders, is really justifyable? No. If I pay the full price-tag for a game then I expect said game to maintain a standard that would seem appropriate, this is why I don't recommend it, because it doesn't meet that standard.Thanks for reading.",0.0

"Before buying this game on PC I had some experience with it on the 360 and loved it. All throughout the reviews of the game you will see people complaining about modders, this is not always the case and I have played with modders and other players but the main thing is if you do not go out of your way to kill them then most likely they will not bother you. However if you do go out of your way to kill people, it can turn on you really fast as in my few hours playing the game I have made 4 friends, three of which were because someone killed like 2 or 3 people in the lobby and we just decided to go after the person. but overall this is a great game and I cannot wait to see what other DLC is released and what differences there will be with GTA 6",1.0

"Mutiplayer is just a scam to get you to buy overpriced shark cards.

They got lost in all the money idiots were spending on the multiplayer scam. Only recently have people realized that the mutiplayer was just a scam , to bad it is to late. The idiot players set the tone since they spent so much on shark cards not realizeing the scam they were buying into. Any and all singleplayer DLC was scrapped because of this. Now they are just doing BS multiplayer DLC. They overpirce it in game with in game currency to bait people into buying shark cards , and people spend HUNDREDS(LITERALLY) of dollars on DLC that would cost $2-$3 dollars in any other game.",0.0

Got this game when it went on sale. It has a good single player and is worth the price (when it is on sale). I say this because multiplayer can be a bad experience because of the hackers that plague the servers. It can also be a good experience when you have friends to play with you. But when you are a solo player then the vehicles that you want can be grindy to get and you may be force to buy premium currency. The only reason I recomment this game is for its single player. If your looking to play in multiplayer with no friends then I cannot recommend this for you,0.0

"The sad part is, this game started out as an actual game. A good one, even! But once the vanilla single player story is over, it stops being a game and turns into a cash grab. I paid good money to own this game, but apparently that's not enough. GTA Online is a joke. 40 minute wait times for public queues into mission you can use to grind up what paltry rewards the game decides you're worthy of, provided you happen to win. The matchmaking is abysmal, not just by happenstance, but by design. Its all to sell shark cards. That's it, that's what the game is now. Shark cards. GTA Online is unplayable without paying extra for shark cards. I've played games that are actually free that are less aggressive about forcing you to pay extra for a fun online experience than GTA Online. And maybe that would be tolerable if you could get more content out of the single player campaign by modding it. But now Take 2 has put a stop to that because people having fun offline doesn't sell shark cards! Forget this game. Forget shark cards. It not worth the price tag anymore. Don't buy the next one either if Take 2 has anything to do with it.",1.0

"As much as I loved and still want to love this game (specifically the GTA: Online) I hate it...Why? Well sit down (if you already are sitting then stand up and sit down again) and let me explain...Grand Theft Auto V has a massive platform for a ♥♥♥♥♥on of different things. Modders and the actual game devs have a possibility to always add something. For example they added more with the bunkers, biker houses and so on, opening and creating new locations.The game has pretty damn awesome graphics even on the lower settings. The system requirements are not too high either. I myself had an Intel Core i5-3570 and Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 Ti and it runs pretty smoothly with high settings as long as there's not a lot of sh*t going on in the game and I let it use all the memory it needs.The game has a pretty fun single player with a pretty good story. Didn't get too much into it but it was a lot of fun to play through. The mods that are still ""legal"" by the limits Take Two have (f**k you guys) bring a lot to the game. Not really gonna get in depth with this because you can find it anywhere if you just type keywords ""GTA V Take Two vs OpenIV""Then we have GTA: Online. It was awesome even after the PC release. For about a year I played it every day I could as long as I could. It was so much fun to play through the heists and f**k around with my friends. It had a lot of content to offer and the entertainment it offered never got boring.Until now! While the DLC have had pretty much cool stuff in my personal opinion they're still just a way to milk more money from the players. The Shark Cash cards you can buy to add in-game currency are too expensive compared to the amount of money you get from it. The mission rewards are too low for you to buy anything from the new DLCs, unless it's the dirt bike or a rusty car you want to buy.The game either requires you to grind for money or buy the cash cards. I myself have always grinded for money. The fastest way I found there to be (unless you own for example a business or an office) is to play the final heist (Pacific Standard Heist) as many times as you can. On the hardest difficulty the total payout (including setup missions) ranges from 200 000$ to 400 000$. A good car costs about 2 millions and the upgrades (depending on the car) eat up a good 1 or 2 millions.After completing the heist there will be a cooldown for it. So you can't grind too fast and besides the game isn't made for grinding. They patch every single trick there is to make it easier/faster to get money. The game has been ruined by too expensive items that you have to get to keep the game entertaining.GTA V does not support online mods. It isn't like in GTA IV where you could see if the lobby would allow Simple Native Trainer (or other mods) to be used. And no, it doesn't help even if you'd only play in Solo/Invite Only sessions without giving yourself money or RP. I used a trainer to f**k around with my friends and we only played in Invite Only sessions.We only used things such as car modifiers (these wouldn't be stored in the car), object spawners (things you couldn't use. Models and so on) and custom animations. These tools should be allowed but however you get banned and at least in my case I lost all my money although it was all legimately earned.In a nutshell, Rockstar punishes you when instead of ruining the game for others you go and screw around with people who wish to do so as well in an invite only lobby where no one can join if they don't want to.They only focus on adding more DLC to GTA: Online and don't add anything to the single player. The Lost and Damned and the Ballad of Gay Tony were amazing DLCs for the single player on GTA IV so Rockstar could make good single player DLCs but they just don't. Why? Because it's not as profitable as Shark Cash cards.In conclusion the game has come to an end. If it was 2015 or 2016 I'd tell you to go buy this instantly, but because of what the game has become (and what it costs normally on Steam) I can't recommend this to anyone. If you don't find it fun to grind in GTA or to play single player with mods, the game is not worth your money.",1.0

"I have put so many hours into GTAV on two different platforms and one of the main reasons I bought it for a second time on PC is for SINGLE PLAYER MODS. I didn't want to ruin anyone elses fun by using mods in multiplayer but Take Two (the guys who own rockstar) have effectivly BANNED MODS, not multiplayer mods, but singleplayer mods. They don't want you to be able to use all the new cool toys in singleplayer so you are forced online and into pulic lobbies with hackers which they can do nothing to stop, to grind money endlessly for stupidly expensive vehicles because flying bikes are cool. OR you can buy shark cards of course which is exactly what they want. They want more money, every content patch and the only way to avoid that trap was to play singleplayer and mod in the new vehicals so you can have fun. Charging for mods like Bethesda are doing deserves it's own level of hell, but this level of scummery claims the deepest darkest level all to itself.",1.0

"Grand Theft Auto 5 is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA 4 brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas.It is one of the very best video games ever made.Grand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece of a game, and the PC version is the best way to experience it. Its sprawling yet meticulously detailed map is the high bar to which all other open-world games aspire, and it’s incredibly dense with excellent content. With so much to do, explore, and play with, both in single-player and multiplayer, plus great creative tools, it’s truly amazing on multiple levels.",1.0

"T2 pushing to criminalise single player modders, in an attempt to keep the micro-transaction cash cow lactating (GTAO), is a sad watershed moment for all open world games...

"I will preface this review by saying that I have had this game since it's release on the Xbox 360, which has as many if not more hours logged than my PC copy. I have had great fun with this game over the time I have played it, and I have to give kudos to Rockstar for continuing to develop new content (this recent Gunrunning update, for example, which adds an appreciable amount of free content). THAT BEING SAID:            I can no longer, in good conscience, support this game or the business practices followed by Rockstar and Take Two Interactive. The basis for my conclusion rests mostly in the way the multiplayer GTA Online service has been handled. I have no problems with the single player Story mode, besides the fact that no substantial new content was ever added to it, limiting it immensely. As an avid player of this game, it did not take long for me to have done everything worthwhile in the Story mode, leaving me with the regularly updated multiplayer (and of course the option of simply replaying the Story mode, which gets stale after the third time). Thus, the only way for me to get any real entertainment out of the game at this point is through the multiplayer.           At first, Online was actually quite good in terms of what a player had to do in order to gain levels and money for what was available at the time (the most expensive single transaction being a Titan plane at GTA$2 million). Missions and races gave an appropriate amount of money and RP for the level of difficulty they presented, and said difficulties made sense and were balanced. A player could easily afford anything they could want with an appropriate amount of playing and grinding said missions. At this point in time, the Shark Cards were acceptable, seeing as the time-to-money-ratio was not terrible and the Shark Cards gave appropriate payouts that reflected the amout of grind skipped proportionate to the values of what was available at launch.           However, it became increasingly apparent, at least to me, that decisions were being made to make earning money more and more difficult while simultaneously making the DLCs more and more expensive in terms of in-game GTA$. The largest initial step made to do this was an across-the-board nerfing of all missions' payouts and RP gain, while also concurrently  PUNISHING  efficient players by instating a system that only allowed the full payout of a mission to be given only if more than (I believe) 20 minutes were spent playing said mission. It's not as if the payouts were reduced a little bit, as many appropriately-lucrative missions had their payouts reduced to almost if not more than 50% of their original payout. This severely neutered all player's ability to fairly gain money severely. All the while, DLCs were released with new, mor expensive items such as super cars that were significantly better than existing models (no original models of super car compare to newer ones in races anymore).           I would not have had a problem with any of what I have said or about to say if one simple model were followed: the value of real money to money gained through Shark Cards should have reflected the new content and increased difficulty of earning money by decreasing the real money needed per GTA$ as time went on. However, cards such as the Great White Shark Card, which gives GTA$1.25 million and costs $50 USD remained the same, and their relative worth in the Online game only decreased. The real cost should have decreased, or the amount of GTA$ given increased (or both at the same time), however this has obviously not been done in any way, shape or form.           Then came the Finance and Felony updates, which promised new ways to earn big money . . . except for the fact that you needed more than GTA$1 million to even  BEGIN USING THE NEW CONTENT.  You had to purchase a CEO office, the cheapest of which, with no additions, costs exactly GTA$1 million, plus at least a small warehouse which all cost around GTA$100,000 or more. In addition, the maximum payout for the cargo missions is GTA$2 million, which can only be achieved with a large warehouse which cost significantly more than small OR medium warehouses. Thus, to even be able to play the full content that was released, you would need upwards of at least GTA$1.5 million. That price would have been realtively acceptable, if not for the aforementioned fact that ALL players' ability to make any appreciable amount of money got severely cut down.           The same case goes for Import/Export, which required an office and vehicle warehouse. It also further encouraged other players to grief one another (for ludicrously paltry rewards, too), which actually discouraged cooperation and interacting with other players, and made many players seek out empty lobbies, ultimately defeating the spirit of Online play in general. Not to mention the insane price tags on the special vehicles, which were all in the multi-million-dollar price ranges. Even with these new ways to make money, it would take full days of gameplay to even be able to make near GTA$2 million. Any player that plays the game fairly from scratch at this point would need hundreds of hours to be able to access all the content. The same goes for the Bikers update, and Gunrunning, which require millions of GTA$ to even become remotely profitable, which is of course made worse by the fact that almost no player is going to have the amount of free time necessary to acquire the GTA$  needed to play all of said content (especially in the case of Gunrunning, which not even Megalodon Shark Card, at $100USD to GTA$8 million, can afford you all the content therein).           All of these factors lead me to conclude that the Online game has been molded to better push the sales of Shark Cards, under the guise of ""free"" DLC. This content cannot be called ""free"" in any sense of the word if the only way to actually play it in any reasonable amount of time is to purchase hundreds of USD-worth of Shark Cards. No normal human being will be able play the amount of hours needed to actually get the money fairly though the game unless they have no other obligations (job, school, family . . . literally anything else OTHER than playing this game). People rely on people who give cheated money, or they cheat themselves simply because there is no other reasonable option (no, buying hundreds of USD-worth of Shark Cards is  NOT REASONABLE ). Also the argument for the Shark Cards being a necessity to keep the DLC free would be more valid if not for the fact that GTA V has been in the top 10 bestselling games on the entirety of Steam  SINCE IT'S PC RELEASE.  Being priced at $60 USD (not to mention themassive sales of other Rockstar titles), that should be more than enough to sustain the release of the DLC.           In addition to these factors, it also seems as if Take Two Interactive wants to demolish the entire GTA V modding community with Cease and Desist orders against benign software such as Open IV (Their claims of it affecting Online play is a bold-faced lie, as Open IV cannot do anything to the Online on it's own, and would require memory injection to have any affect whatsoever, in additon to the fact that Open IV is not even used in this way either, as there are better tools for affecting the Online game). Whatever your opinion of modifying GTA V, there is much evidence pointing to mods improving the longevity of games. It is my opinion that GTA Online has reached a point where it is no longer viable for most people to play the game fairly and is thusly inappropriate for the publisher (Take Two) to lash out at these people when they should actually pay attention to their consumer base for once and fix the Online game's business model. Of course, I doubt they would ever do this, depsite all the negative press they are continually generating for themselves, BECAUSE:  Money. ",1.0

The single player is pretty good and some of the online if you have preexisting group of friends but the promised single player DLC and never delivered. All DLC has been for online play and mostly for the easier to develop(I assume) adversary modes. The best part of GTA Online were the heists but they never released more because they take more work than a new race or adversary mode. Rockstar has allowed modding in single player forever but suddenly Take Two threatens the people that add content to the game an make it worth continuing to play. Bottom line. R* and Take Two want you to play their online game where everything costs way too much so that you will buy GTA cash from them via shark cards. If you aren't going to do that then they have no interest in you playing their game. Spend your money elsewhere and get a game that allows the community to produce content so that you get value for your money.,1.0

"The game  had a lot of promise, a good single player narrative with good graphics and an open world with a lot of character.The multiplayer while initially seeming good is held back by its poor design requiring ether outragious amounts of time investment (making GTA Online the only game you would ever play) or outright HAVING to buy sharkcards to actually earn really good things.An the modding scene was bright with an active community with many great mods such as the Visual overhaul, greatly improving graphics and gameplay mods like the Ironman and Hulk mods or even mods that add the new multiplayer content to singleplayer (since the devs do not add any of the cool new updates to single player). However Take2 the most inept and biggest failure of a publisher in memory has banned the usage of mods even in the single player hitting the creators of the most prominant modding tool OpenIV with a ceise and desist. ♥♥♥♥ this Game, if you support it you are potentionally supporting a very grim future for PC gaming and gaming in general.",1.0

"15/06/17 - Just found out about Take-Two issuing a cease and desist to the OpenIV team... So on top of everything else, they still need to screw their customers EVEN MORE by trying to outright stop modding for GTA 4 and 5. Modding the SINGLE-PLAYER might I add. The theory is they want to push people onto the multiplayer by taking away options on the single-player and, as I say in this very review, the multiplayer is a♥♥♥♥♥♥fest full of grinding in a concerted effort to force microtransactions down your throat. SORRY BEING A TOP 5 BEST SELLING GAME OF ALL TIME ISN'T ENOUGH FOR YOU TAKE-TWO. WE ONLY BOUGHT IT MULTIPLE ♥♥♥♥ING TIMES. I strongly urge everybody to get the word out, warn people about this kind of thing. If they get away with this, who knows where it could lead...------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Crappy business practice. Not that I'm suprised to find out Rockstar love money, just look at the fact they managed to get people to buy the same game 3 times and get away with it.Business practices aside GTA V is a solid game with a decent story but frankly, in my opinion, the online could have been better. The fun people had with GTA IV... But I guess we have to take our online fun with our friends seriously because stock markets and houses and stuff. I miss being able to do all the silly things online with people like the carmageddon mod or the LCPDFR mod where you could be police and arrest people. While at first I saw the idea of GTA Online being cool I realised that to have fun you gotta work for it (just like real life! YAY!) or you could... Y'know... Buy money...I appreciate the great work behind GTA V as it is, in a number of ways, better than GTA IV. With superior stability and performance as well as more to do and a bigger, more varied world to mess around in. No more do you find yourself trapped in nothing but a reasonably sized city. Now you can run over cougars! Or whatever else it is people do outside.I found it hard to decide whether I should give this game a thumbs up or a thumbs down... At first. But I felt the answer should reflect my complete opinion on the game. The multiplayer is garbage, if I wanted to play an unrealistic MMO based on real-life where money is hyperinflated to the point where a chocolate bar costs around $100 then I shouldn't be allowed to have the things I want.The main sticking points for the multiplayer are:-Real fun with friends-More grind than you could ever want or need to any reasonable extentjesuschristand that's the thing, the grind is the worst I've faced. That's a fullstop (or period whatever). But oh how generous of them to give the option to pay real money to gain fake money. Wonderful. It's hard to really convey just how awful it is with human words. Just know that to get anything remotely cool you're looking at either hours upon hours of grinding (pray to whatever gods you hold that you have friends to help or you're ♥♥♥♥ed) or spend a modest sum of roughly.... Oh yeah- ABOUT AS MUCH AS THE BLOODY GAME COST. How'd you feel about paying £60-£80 for a yacht? And how would you feel if when you discovered it does jack♥♥♥♥♥♥anyway? That's GTA Online. All grind; No substance. UPDATE:After hearing about FiveM (the awesome multiplayer mod seperate from GTA Online) and how the developers were completely screwed over for ridiculous reasons I feel like I can't stand by Rockstar at all, let alone when GTA 5's concerned... As people have said before, GTA Online is a hacker ridden mess with plenty of bugs and grind to go around. Not only that but it seems like it functions much like a free-to-play game, existing only to coax people into spending insane amounts of money on micro-transactions (BTW Wanna buy some Shark Cards?). GTA Online literally has typical rip-off f2p game written all over it, yet it comes part of a fully priced game... The community steps forward to literally fix Rockstar's mess, creating a much more enjoyable experience in the process and they trash it. And why? The mod ""contains code designed to facilitate piracy"". ♥♥♥♥ me, I wonder why people would want to avoid giving you money...",1.0

"i love the game. ive played dozens of hours on playstation. but i honestly cant recommend it. the game was nice a couple of years back. it had serious content. serious players. and wasnt completely ruined by people who killed everybody they saw, and hackers running rampant. for some reason, they seem to be advertising their own ''micro'' (expensive) transactions alot. making new bundles, all the time. which is weird, considering how much this game has already cashed in. whomever is controlling the future of this game. ran it right into a wall. flying bikes? players with tanks so modified nobody can touch them, and boy, do they destroy everything. this game had a nice run. but it somehow, slowly turned into saints row. for salty kids. id love to recommend it. the main story is amazing. but i cant. because of how little the devs does to fix anything. and how much they do to get more money.",1.0
"I would not recommend this game what-so-ever. 2K games have made it extremely clear that all they want is money. They don't want to make a good game, they don't want to make people happy. They couldn't care less what your experience is playing their games and they don't give a rats a** about how you feel about it. All they want is your money and then you could go die in a hole for all they care. It's like going to your absolutely most favorite place to eat. The food is always great, the staff are always friendly and you always have a good time. But then your favorite place is bought out by 2K games; now they didn't change much. Food is still great, staff is still friendly. But now eveytime you walk through the doors 2K spits in your face and tells you that you're worthless scum. It's pretty much how I feel. One of the best selling games on the planet and it's still not making enough money for those greedy bastards. 2K games, you're bad. And you should feel bad. I do not recommend this game or any other game currently released by 2K Games.",1.0
lets say its a good game but please fix the fps drop problem i can run this game at very high settings 60 fps and i have fps drop at all settings still gonna recommend it though,1.0
"Won't say anything about the Online cause I almost don't play it, but the Single Player is still one of my favorites games to this day. Nice story, interesting characters, a lot of things to do. It's not flawless though… the police this time is a pain in the♥♥♥♥♥instead of beying fun. And I really miss things we had in previous GTA games like eating in food places and stands, playing pool and bowling. Well you can't have it all I guess…",1.0
"I'm not gonna hate it too much nor I'm gonna love it too much.alright so where should we start? how about where the game starts, you and your friends are robbing a bank, michael gets shot, travor thinks he's dead and yada yada yada.now let's be honnest nobody, and i mean nobody cares about the stories in the GTA series, GTA is a game about gameplay, violance, gore and etc. so don't expect a really great story.so is this game worth the price? the single player and the multiplayer.GAMEPLAY-Now the gameplay, it's great, you have the controll to make the game first person or third person, which is based of the famous mod from GTA IV (the last game of the franchise).-Gun menue: you can open your gun wheel while game is on slow-motion which means it's slight more easier to choose your gun except in multiplayer you don't have the slow-motion,but the gun wheel menue is way easier then just pressing the ""next weapon"" button to scroll between guns trying to find the one you want.-The Shooting Mechanics: controlling your sight is a lot easier in the new game, ESPECIALLY if you're using controller, it's just lot softer, not too slow or not too fast-Character's Special Abilities: now it's a little bit odd to have a character being able to slow time but it is a little helpful to the un-skilled new players.-Driving: not too many changes but the driving mechanic is great and all but shooting while driving is a really hard thing mostly in single player so i think rockstar should've added a aim assisstance while driving a vehicle.Realism: well GTA always was a game trying to simulate a criminal's life, it can even be called ""the crime simulator"", so having realism will make the game much better and fun, but having characters changing their clothes between switches, is really annoying, like i put time to choose the clothes for example, trevor, and when i do a mission as franklin when i switch back to travor i see him in the deserts of Los Santos wearing a female dress, so i think they should fix that.GRAPHICSthe graphics are great, whether if it's the PC version or the consoles, it's still great and it's enjoyable. so a TINK on that one cause you got it right.CHARACTERS & PERSONALITIESthe characters are interesting with interesting personalities, michael, a white retired thief who is trying to live a happy life, franklin, a slightly sterotypical african-american thug who is trying to make a few bucks for living, and trevor, a white mentally disordered bi-sexual who is insane and psychopathic and enjoys murder and causing chaos and violance, there's other characters but they're not worth your and my time, so far these 3 are different characters with different personalities to eachother and probably different from all of the other character in the trilogy (if the games take place in the same universe).MULTI-PLAYERWell at first it was a mess in console and every one f*cking hated it, after 3 years releasing the PC version had no problem... except one thing, the character you make sometimes appears with weird black lines on his body and his pants or legs, in order to fix this however is to download an Nvidia app (soonly will add its full name) that fixes the textures of games and you're good to go, but in general the multi-player is fun, especially if you're playing with your friends, though they're lots of D ouchies that kill you for no reason, but you can still have fun, there's more clothes for the characters then single player, you get to play as your own character, lots and lots of heist missions, cars, houses, side missions like PvP and etc. there's also this ranking up mechanic that each job you do or each store that you rob gives you RP (Rankup Points) and if you get the maximum mount of the RP of that level you level up to a new title like ""thug"" or ""heister"" and etc, each level you pass and new title you earn unlocks you new cars, new missions, new gun skins / modification and the guns themselve's, body armor, clothes and etc. making money in this multiplayer is a little bit hard and cheating will result in players getting banned, your best bet is rather keep playing till you make lots of cash or buy cards from the online stores for real money to give you GTA money. you cannot use the website on the your phone like single player, trading is only availible in Single-Player mode, and as a personal recemmendation, do not download ""cheat hacks"" that some say it will give you infinite money or whatever in the game, those are most virus or other programs, they are mostly trolls, if there is any real program that will hack the game rockstar removes it, such as they did to videos in youtube that teached how to use glitches to earn money, so if you find a video claiming it's a real hack don't download, or do incase you don't care if it's virus and you really want to try it bad. you do you.Finally, it's time to give this game a score, it was a great game, good gameplay but they released the game too late for the PC version, when they announced GTA 6, which is why i give this game 9/10 and a BADASS badge seal of a proval, rockstar i gotta tell you, you did a great job at this, and i say it's worth your money, and i hope they add new dlc for like more clothing, more cars, more guns and haircuts and all that, so rockstar don't let the game just die, and keep it up with some good old DLC. thanks to you who read this, and i hope you like the game too.Bye-Rose",1.0

"The graphics are great if you have the right specs and singleplayer is just a dream. But multiplayer in a nutshell... horrible. Modders. Modders EVERYWHERE. My friend who played this game since it came out got banned because a modder gave him a few billion ""dollars"" in game. He called R* and asked what to do. Rockstar asked him for his username and told him they would fix it. A few minutes later he got banned. If R* doesn't change its attitude towards it's customers NOW, GTA V Online will probably be full of unpunished modders in a few months or so. If you want to buy the game for Online then dont. Buy anything but GTA V for Online. I have lost all respect for this game.",1.0

This has the could have been a great game but the problem I have is Rockstar is a frankly terrible company that has no intrest in the quality of their products meaning that this game will have the worst community who will ever find that is full of modders with no greater goal than to make your life a living hell and Rockstar has thus far shown no intrest in addressing this problem nor any other they have come across after the game's initial release.,0.0
"This ♥♥♥♥ing game was the♥♥♥♥♥♥when it came out. It broke world records. It was Rockstar's masterpiece.But, they got too greedy with GTA Online, and just for the sake of selling Shark Cards, they ruined the ♥♥♥♥ing game in every single way possible. Everything is a goddamn *intentional* inconvenience and nothing is fun, so they can just bring you to buying shark cards. They're too lazy to add anything players want. The gameplay is like I said, just inconvenience after inconvenience. Cheap cashgrabs after cashgrabs. I can't be bothered with explaining anything at all, you're just going to have to take my word for it or get ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s shoven down your throat yourself to learn the hard way.I still find myself coming back to it at times, but that's just because I played it once in its former glory...

"Singleplayer => Great!Multiplayer => Terrible! (unless you just want to race lobby with friends)As you can see from the large influx of negative reviews, PC gamers aren't very happy when they are punished for having fun with mods and trying to have a great time, especially when forcing microtransactions are the only reason why Rockstar would want to do that.Don't bother with the multiplayer, you'll get much more enjoyment from mods and singleplayer. :)And teach Rockstar a lesson by negatively reviewing them if you dissagree with their practices!",1.0

"I loved the game till a few months ago, when an update broke it.  My computer has:i7 2600gtx 97016 GB of ram game installed on SSDI get 60 fps with settings on high, but as soon as I get a single wanted star fps drops to 1!!  I have written Rockstar support and gotten a chain letter, checked online and only found people who have never gotten the issue fixed or didn't have a computer good enough to play it in the first place.I have been patient but still no update to fix it.  The game was fun till it broke.  And yes i did all the stuff recommended online even did a fresh install but still no dice.So i recommend checking online about stuttering issues from the game before you buy it and if you still buy it atleast you can return it through steam refunds. Hope you have better luck than me.",1.0
"I will say that my experience has overall been mixed. I throughly enjoy the game at it's core, though the community is a bit below average. Tons of Hacking/Modding in the game can overall make it unfun for those like me, who wish to play the game proper. Also, in recent news, the developer has decided to ban random people for no reason, which for me, seems completely assinine. I warn all who decide to play that you may be one of those who get banned and in Rockstar's own words ""All bans are FINAL"". I would recommend to stay away, but hey, I won't stop you.",1.0

"WARNING YOU CAN NO LONGER TRANSFER YOUR OLD XBOX OR PS4 PLAYER, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. Came from console and was hoping to get my old character back, character transfer ended on 6th March (I had no idea) so I'm going to refund. With the lack of mod support, me having completed the story twice and rockstar wanting to milk me dry by making me create a whole new character even though I have an old character with nearly a months playtime on, there is virtually no point of me owning this game. Unless this is a complete fresh game to you and you have never played it before, please stay clear and spend your money elsewhere.",1.0
"There was a decent stretch of time where I would have wholeheartedly recommended this game to anyone. A MASSIVE open world game where the singleplayer story and content is on point and the multiplayer was fun with friends. Now though, I can't say the same. The singleplayer campaign is still great, but multiplayer has deceneded to the point where unless you shell out well over $100 extra, there's no chance you get most of the content. Singleplayer is good, but there was no extra content for it from Rockstar directly even when multiplayer has now dozens of easily port-able vehicles that singleplayer doesn't see. You know what saved the singleplayer and kept it interesting? Modding. Mods opened up new, fresh vehicles, areas, and activities. It allowed you to screw around freely with even the multiplayer vehicles that Rockstar went through effort to make you only use in MP. Yesterday Take Two interective crossed a line. They sent out a cease and decist to THE MODDING TOOL for GTA V, OpenIV. [This has now been remedied, but most of my points still stand. Take-Two DID send a cease a cease and desist, and only because of this kind of backlash did Rockstar and Take-Two enter talks with OpenIV, if we hadn't reacted they would have continued on their merry money-grubbing way] Not something that used copywritten content or let people cheat in multiplayer, but something that opened the doors for people to mess around harmlessly in singleplayer. All because they want to force people onto multiplayer where they can squeeze you for every last cent. Good job Take Two, you didn't make money by moving people to multplayer. You instead lost money by sticking a massive middle finger at the entire singleplayer community.",1.0

i think this game would be better if you could do online things in a private lobby so there isnt a guy that is in batman cosplay that can blast your car (even if armored) into smitherines but more seriously the main thing plaguing this game is the amount of cheaters and it plauges this game because it makes me mad that i cant find the cheates they're using but also this game decides to give men a lot of clothes even tho they're kinda trash but girls get like 3 scarves and a pocket full of lint to wear but anyways this game is fun and i think it's a cool thing and i like it but not because its a good game but because all of my friends like it and if i didnt they would excommunicate metl;dr this game is actually pretty good but not that good because there are things that make it badXOXOXOXO love tim,1.0
"It's the game that finally came out!  What can I say?  It's the latest and greatest GTA game!GraphicsThe graphics on this game absolutely blows away GTA IV.  I remember when GTA IV was looked at as beautiful, but GTA V sometimes looks photorealistic (even though I don't have a killer gaming rig).  I can only imagine what this game looks like maxed out.  Even with my GTX 660 (with the 2GB of VRAM being a bit limiting for a game like this), the game runs smooth as silk while the shadows, water, and grass (oh my gosh, the grass...  You'd have to see it to understand how good it looks) all look super realisitc.StoryI liked the story quite a bit.  The characters are all as unique as in the other GTA games, and having three main characters allows more room for interesting conversations.  The FBI stuff is a bit weird at times, but everything else is solid, and I never felt like I didn't want to watch a cutscene.GameplayMUCH improved over GTA IV.  The shooting is taken from Max Payne 3, and the driving from a racing game.  No more clunky shooting or tedious driving.  The flying controls are a weird one.  It took me a minute to adapt to WASD+NumPad, but I felt like I had great control once I did.  I had friends that absolutely couldn't get over the fact that there weren't good keyboard+mouse controls.  Besides the flying, everything felt natural and great!OnlineGTA Online, the place where most of your hours go.  There is so much to do, unlike GTA IV.  Deathmatch, several different types of racing, the absolutely insane adversary modes (truckers vs bikers, quad bikes vs heavily armed guys on foot, PvP wave-based survival...), heists, and FREE ROAM.  Free Roam is GTA as it was meant to be.  Traverse the entire map in a 32 person online server.  Spend your earned money on super cars or military vehicles and do whatever crazy stuff you want to do.  It's insane.The online performance has seemed to improve drastically, but desync and general lag do occasionally occur.In short, if you liked other GTA games and meet the min requirements for the game, you should get it.  It's crazy, it's pretty, and it's fun.",1.0

It would be a positive review taking in consideration the time i put in this game and the fun i got out of it.

"For all the people complaining about ""ohhhhh i got banned for modding on single player!"". Its only our PC players faults for cracking GTA 4 and not giving Rockstar any money for their product. They were hesitant about releasing GTA 5 on PC for that exact reason so if they use DRM to control the hacking and cracking and banning players. If you want to blame someone stand in the mirror and have a good hard look at yourself. Personally i love playing GTA 5, i only play online because i completed story mode on my 360 before it was released on PC. And that's why the game gets a positive review.",1.0
"I'm going to be honest, plain and simple. The only reason I bought the PC version was because 1. To play with friends that only use pc version and 2. Single player mods. Now, I have work back to the top because of the disabling of character transfers, and these fun mods- and useful mods- have been entirely removed. So, no more rockstar for me, because the reasons I had for playing have been entirely obliterated",1.0
"Now, where do I start with one of my all-time favs. Well, I played this on PS3, loved it. I'm currently playing this on PS4, still amazing. And most recently I bought and played it on Steam and had so many issues.I couldn't even full screen the game and searched online for like 15 minutes just to figure out how to fullscreen the game. Then when I played it I experienced a♥♥♥♥♥♥ton of lag and had a solution, lowering the graphics quality. This barely even helped, and the game still has lag. Really♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥me off anytime I try to play it it becomes a chore just playing a video game.Now, I rate this up because GTA V was and still is a phenomal game, PC is the only platform that has given me any severe lag. And this is understandable, GTA V is very hard to process especially on a cheap PC like mine. So yes it works better on other computers that can process the game a lot faster.So, if I could rate it with stars I would rate it 4.9/5 stars. The tenth of that star is missing just because of all the damned lag I've experienced trying to play this. The game is still good even on PC, and I withstand the lag even when it's really bad because hell, it's GTA V and I want to play the game so I'll be patient.To conclude, I highly recommend buying the game for any Steam users other than those with an awful computer like me who can't afford a new one. You may want to think it out before blowing a lot of money on a game that lags a ton.Bad Computer: Consider whether you really need to buy this game unlike me.Good or even Decent Computer: Buy it now, the game doesn't dissapoint. It's so incredibly fun, you won't regret buying this.",1.0
Best game I have ever played.,1.0
After many hours in this game I've come to a conclusion that this company is just disguised EA. This game is nothing but a bloody cashgrab. lets give example with new popular jet that costs something around 7M ingame money that is about 35€ in real money if we convert it via shark cards. for 1 miserable jet. And there is more. To make money in this game you must spend money. It's utter garbage instead of DLCs that cost 10€ you get ridiculously expensive stuff marketed as free dlc that you have to grind for 40 hours to get. They put new car as FREE when it's x-mas and everyone still lost their money. This game isn't fun if you're not willing to spend real money to get fun stuff. Needless to say single-player will never get updates ever.,1.0

They don't try to improve the experience, pushing out a bunch of events that no one seems to care about, releasing new content that require days of grinding and instead forcing everyone to buy their absurd shark cards, which people still apparently get banned for.Another thing which I found cute is that now their support page reminds you over and over no bans, no matter what, may be appealed and are AUTOMATICALLY closed. So even when they ban people fo no reason: tough luck. Not to mention, do you know what I'll find when I log on a month later, all of my hard work reset back to nothing?

"Basically, Rock Star hates you and only cares about your money. That was obvious from the day it first released, and the fact that it still cost a full $60, despite coming over a year later than the console versions. The screwing-over didn't stop there, though. They started charging ridiculous amounts of money for in game currency. Instead of discounting their game during Steam sales, they would only sell ""discounted"" bundles that included this in-game currency... but which still cost at least $60. When this currency apparently wasn't selling well enough, they started adding a constant stream of crazily over-priced in-game items. It used to be that there were only a couple things you could get for over a million, but now they're a dime  a dozen.And all of these complaints are only valid when the game actually works. GTA V decided to buck the trend of other AAA games; instead of improving over time, it actually gets worse! Now, It can take me up to thirty minutes just to get into an online game and stay in it. And recently, hackers managed to somehow take all of my ammo; rebuying it would cost over a hundred thousand in game dollars, which would conservatively take about an hour to earn back.Finally, they're recently started screwing over creators of single-player mods, which is hard to believe is anything other than an attempt to make even more money with some other upcoming monetization scheme.",0.0
"Picked up this game during the winter sale. It's a pretty game and all but there are some things you should know before buying it if you plan to play online. I have 78 hours, a third of which have been spent in failed attempts to join a lobby or fleeing lobbies with ""hackers"" in it that just put a ♥♥♥♥ing Xmas tree over my character or keep killing me thru passive mode.If you do buy this game, you better get used to the following errors:-rockstar cloud couldnt find your stuff try again later --LOL here are some more ads for Card Shark-rockstar cloud found your stuff but ♥♥♥♥ you, it doesnt want to load, try again later.-the game needs some files it could not download try again later-unabled to connect to cloud, cant save your game ...yeah, you guessed it, try again later. You need more patience than skill to be able to enjoy online mode.Online mode and it is p2p issues are the only reason I do not recommend this game since this mode is where you will be able to take full advantage of their content releases but if you just wanna play single mode and satisfy those feels of GTAIII nostalgia, then the game is great.

Keep in mind that OpenIV only affects single player, so it has nothing to do with the abundance of cheaters in the MP sessions.",1.0
"You've been popping blackheads wrong all your life.Face it Rockstar.In a game where practically anything is possible, brown people still exist. Once. Just once i would like to make an indian man grovel. Just one time please rockstar, just please allow me to lower his pudding encrusted face to the curb with his hands behind his back. I want him to place the gravelled stone against his teeth, I want to make his filthy yellow teeth scrape against the concrete floor. I want the man to beg for his life. And then, god i've wished for this each time i've blown out my candles, i want to slam my foot down with the force of a hydraulic piston at the back of his disgusting meatball of a head, over and over and over and over and over and over. I want to be like the grape stomper at a wine festival in spain. I want his head to physically resemble a jumbo sized caramel filled, kinder surprise egg that some rage driven autist has smashed with his greasy, paste covered fists. I want his body to twitch manically as i punt his skull open with the heel of my steel capped boots. I want my muscles to ache, to tear under the stress and duration of this bless'd act. Then, I want the family of this cow worshipping rat to eat the remains of his head. Then. and only then. Will i allow them the false illusion of safety. This is where i bring in the steamroller. They'll be too busy crying and gibbering in their mania to hear me drive up behind them. What follows, can be considered a recipe for Dosa(indian pancakes). I will continue to reverse, and drive over their 2D remains more times than there are grains of sand on the earth. And once i am satasfied. I will pull down my pants, and drop a hot, slimy cylinder of♥♥♥♥♥♥onto the now concrete infused bodies.I will flatten their entire ♥♥♥♥ing monkey village",0.0

"This game was really fun on Xbox and im sure its even more fun on PC and id live to play if it wasnt for the fact that i cant stay in game for more then 15 minutes. they game crashes way too much for what it is, its benn delayed and has a large team that should know what they are doing. ive looked everywhere and i cant find one solution that works or anything from rockstar saying they are working on it or even that they know that the game is crashing for so many people. i payed for a game this big it shouldnt be crashing this much. ive seen early access games made by a single person that crash less then this.",1.0
"Grand Theft Auto V is great if you are planning to have a good time with some friends doing follies around town and playing missions, if you have the patience to wait several minutes for every loading screen and experience frequent server crashes that will result in more several minutes long loading screens.Other than this, the campaign story failed to impress me, and I won’t judge it harshly for the simple reason that I couldn’t be bothered enough to complete it, and the level of grinding for money and EXP required from the multiplayer is simply criminal.I don’t play multiplayer games, but every time I do I found more reasons to keep myself away from them.",1.0

"This is a GTA main title.. that should say enough. This is an awesome game and it is amazingly ported to PC, especially compared to 4. Rockstar stepped their game up for this port and it was working right out of the box for me. The 3 main characters are all likable in their individual ways and make for a really interesting story. Switching between all of them makes for a fun and unique gameplay experience since each character has a special ability that they can utilize in different situations. The world map is really big and has a lot of things to do and find even though it doesn't sprawl across the entire state like San Andreas did. Recommended to anyone who likes open world games or anyone who has played previous GTA games. The graphics look really great and there are mods online that allow you to crank them up even higher. The gameplay is also great, it feels engaging and always keeps you finding more things to do, especially if you play GTA: Online. I recommend using a controller to play since driving is much cleaner with one but mouse and keyboard work fine as well.",1.0
"what the actual ♥♥♥♥ is wrong with the Devs, still no fix for launcher crash, tried everything, this is great game but your bringing down the vibe. pull you fingers out of your asses and fix the ♥♥♥♥ING GAME. 8/10 story, 8/10 multiplayer.",1.0

"Take-Two, I really hope you're going to do something to ease the raging inferno that's going on throughout the GTA modding community.I love the game, but I currently can't recommend it until some form of solution can be made so that modders can still freely mod the single player portion as they wish while allowing the multiplayer portion to run with fewer risks of running into cheaters.",1.0

"Somehow I am writting a review for GTA V even though I don't have it. Don't ask me how I can do this, because I really don't know. But I am. So. Yeah. It's good I guess. I'm probably going to buy it soon. When did you guys buy it? Hmm. Cool. Well, I hope I have helped you make your final decision on if you want to buy GTA V. Have a wonderful day ( ͡~ ͜ʖ ͡°)",1.0
"Rockstar just lost a lot of respect from a large part of it's playerbase. (UK Customer) I paid £39.99 on release, current standalone price is £51.98 but a -25% discount makes it £38.98. This kind of business practice is actually against ASA regulations, raising the price of a game and then putting it on sale to make it look like it's actually reduced is not considered a fair marketing strategy in the UK.With regards to the bundle with ""Great White Shark Cash Card"" at the same price of £38.98, it's a move that isn't really on the side of the consumer or in the spirit of past steam sales. It has only been out for 2 months on PC so I don't think anyone was hoping for a big discount but putting it in a bundle and slapping a -25% discount on it really means the consumer isn't saving at all. They're getting some free in-game money which might be nice for some people but I think if most wanted the game + In-game money bundle they'd have prepurchased it when the in-game money was also free. I hope people don't just see the -25% discount and think they're getting a great deal by saving 25%, beacuse they're really not. You're either getting some free in-game money or - even worse - nothing at all with the standalone discount. GTA V is a great game but if you were looking to save on it you won't be in this current steam sale.Rockstar, please treat your customers with more respect.",1.0
Absolutely one of the best fun awesome games out there! Glad I purchased it ;-),1.0
This game is SO AWESOME,1.0
"After so many hours in this game I've come to the conclussion that without a moder giving you money or buying shark cards, the grind you have to go through in order to get a CEO office, a (at least) medium Warehouse, a vehicle warehouse, a Bunker and a Coccaine lab is literally H E L L. It is a gigantic, enormous, tremendous grind. Until you get those the only option you have for making money is to spam the pacific Standard heist as the host over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over again. It is an absolutely terrible experience with random people. The heist as well as the setups take around 2 hours to finish regularly but with randoms...no no no...forget about it. You'll just sit there all day and do a couple setups.However, after you get all the businesses I mentioned above everything becomes so much more easier and actually fun. You do resupply and crate missions which can be done on your own and the only times when you might need help is when you're about to sell or if you want to get more supplies out of 1 resupply mission (more people=more supplies in one run).Obviously everything new that comes out is overpriced as hell. You will soon realise that most of the cool new vehicles and new armed vehicles that get released with every DLC are pretty much useless since they cannot be used in heists, just freemode. Unless you find griefing useful, then all the new stuff that gets released is useless. On second thought, the only use they might have is when you use those vehicles to protect your cargo when selling or resupplying but for that to happen you need at least 2 more people to operate the vehicle.The anti-cheat is dreadful, an utter disaster; bans innocent players, removes legitimate money and when it comes to bans and other similar stuff R* support is as supportive as.....emmmm......something not supportive, at all.The only reason I'm giving this a thumbs up is because it is very fun with friends. Like I said above if you are playing on your own you will soon realise that since the new vehicles that are being released are pretty much useless, then so are your grinding efforts. Unless of course you grind just for the fun of it (which I do which means that it's not a grind at that point, just missions for fun).Finally, a word about  the story mode: It’s amazing!!P.S. Buy this only on sale.",1.0
